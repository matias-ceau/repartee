# Repartee

> **AI that knows your knowledge**

Repartee is a command-line AI assistant that integrates with your personal knowledge base. Unlike generic AI tools that forget everything after each session, Repartee understands your notes, documents, and accumulated wisdom‚Äîmaking your knowledge available in every conversation.

**Status**: Active development | **Version**: 0.2.0 | **Target**: v1.0 in 6 months

## üéØ Why Repartee?

**The Problem**: You have 100s or 1000s of notes in Obsidian, Logseq, or Markdown files. When you ask ChatGPT or Claude a question, they have no idea this knowledge exists.

**The Solution**: Repartee indexes your notes, builds a knowledge graph, and automatically retrieves relevant information during conversations. It's like having an AI assistant that's actually read all your notes.

**The Difference**: Most CLI agents are either coding-focused (Aider, Continue.dev) or generic chatbots (ChatGPT CLI). Repartee bridges the gap‚Äîit's an AI assistant designed for **knowledge workers** with extensive personal knowledge management systems.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üß† Knowledge Integration (Unique to Repartee)
- **Obsidian Vault Integration**: Import and search your entire Obsidian vault
- **Knowledge Graph**: Automatically builds concept maps from your notes
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant notes using AI embeddings
- **Auto-Context Injection**: Relevant notes are automatically added to conversations

### üíæ Advanced Memory Systems
- **Short-term Memory**: Current conversation context with intelligent truncation
- **Episodic Memory**: Searchable history of past conversations with vector embeddings
- **Semantic Memory**: Structured knowledge graph for concepts and relationships
- **Cross-Session Context**: AI remembers relevant information across conversations

### üîå Multi-Provider Support
- **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.)
- **Anthropic** (Claude 3.7/3.5 Sonnet)
- **Google** (Gemini 1.5 Pro)
- **Perplexity** (Sonar models)
- **Local Models** (Ollama support - coming soon)

### üñ•Ô∏è Multiple Interfaces
- **CLI**: Quick one-shot queries and interactive conversations
- **REPL**: Persistent interactive shell (coming soon)
- **TUI**: Rich terminal UI with Textual (coming soon)

### üîí Privacy First
- **Local-First Design**: All data stored on your machine (XDG-compliant)
- **Local Model Support**: Run entirely offline with Ollama (coming soon)
- **Private Mode**: Zero data sent to external APIs (coming soon)
- **Transparent Storage**: Clear data handling, no hidden tracking

## üì¶ Installation

**Requirements**: Python 3.13+ (we're working on supporting 3.11+)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/matias-ceau/repartee.git
cd repartee

# Install using uv (recommended)
uv pip install -e .

# Or using pip
pip install -e .
```

**Note**: Repartee is in active development. Some features are still being implemented.

## Configuration

Repartee requires API keys to access language models. Set them as environment variables:

```bash
# OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key

# Anthropic API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key

# Google AI API key
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key

# Perplexity API key
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-key
```

Or create a `.env` file in your home directory with these keys.

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Interactive conversation with default model
repartee

# Use Anthropic's Claude
repartee -p anthropic

# Specify a particular model
repartee -p openai -m gpt-4-turbo

# One-shot query
repartee "What is the capital of France?"
```

### Working with Your Knowledge

```bash
# Import your Obsidian vault
repartee --import-obsidian ~/path/to/vault

# Search your notes
repartee "What did I write about machine learning?"

# Get answers using your knowledge
repartee "Summarize my notes on Python async programming"
```

### Advanced Features

```bash
# List recent conversations
repartee --list-conversations

# Continue a previous conversation
repartee --continue <conversation-id>

# Export conversation to Markdown
repartee --export <conversation-id>
```

## Memory Architecture

Repartee implements a multi-layered memory architecture:

1. **Short-Term Memory**: Manages the current conversation context with token-aware truncation to maintain context within model limits.

2. **Episodic Memory**: Stores conversation history with vector embeddings for semantic search, allowing the retrieval of relevant past exchanges.

3. **Semantic Memory**: Implements a knowledge graph that stores concepts and relationships, with special support for importing from Obsidian vaults.

## Development

For development, uv makes dependency management simple:

```bash
# Add a new dependency
uv pip install some-package

# Update the lock file
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
