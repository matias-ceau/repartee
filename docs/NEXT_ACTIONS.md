# Next Actions for Repartee Development

This document provides immediate, actionable next steps based on the analysis completed in October 2025.

## TL;DR

✅ **The project should continue**  
🎯 **Focus on**: Knowledge integration + polished UX + privacy  
⏰ **Timeline**: 6 months to 1.0 release  
📊 **Effort**: ~250 hours of development  

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Lower Python Version Requirement [30 minutes]
```bash
# Edit pyproject.toml
requires-python = ">=3.11"  # Currently 3.13+

# Test on Python 3.11 and 3.12
# Update README with version requirements
```

**Why**: Currently requires Python 3.13+ which very few users have. This is blocking adoption.

### 2. Set Up Testing Infrastructure [2 hours]
```bash
# Install pytest
uv pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio

# Create basic test structure
mkdir -p tests/unit tests/integration
touch tests/conftest.py
touch tests/unit/test_config.py
touch tests/unit/test_memory.py

# Add to pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
```

**Why**: No reliable tests = users will hit bugs. Need foundation for confidence.

### 3. Implement Basic Logging [3 hours]
```python
# Create src/repartee/logger.py

import logging
from pathlib import Path
from repartee.config import get_data_dir

def setup_logger(name: str, level: str = "INFO") -> logging.Logger:
    """Set up logger with file and console handlers."""
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(getattr(logging, level))
    
    # File handler
    log_dir = Path(get_data_dir()) / "logs"
    log_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    fh = logging.FileHandler(log_dir / "repartee.log")
    fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    
    # Console handler
    ch = logging.StreamHandler()
    ch.setLevel(getattr(logging, level))
    
    # Formatter
    formatter = logging.Formatter(
        '%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
    )
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)
    ch.setFormatter(formatter)
    
    logger.addHandler(fh)
    logger.addHandler(ch)
    
    return logger
```

**Why**: Debugging user issues is impossible without logs.

### 4. Add CI/CD Pipeline [1 hour]
```yaml
# Create .github/workflows/test.yml

name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -e .
        pip install pytest pytest-cov
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest --cov=repartee tests/
```

**Why**: Catch bugs before they reach users. Professional appearance.

## Next Month (Week 5-8)

### Priorities
1. **Complete REPL mode** - Make it actually useful for daily work
2. **Build Textual TUI** - Modern, rich terminal interface
3. **Polish CLI** - Better help text, examples, error messages
4. **Conversation management** - Save, load, search conversations

### Deliverable
- v0.4.0 with complete TUI and REPL
- Demo video showing key features
- 5+ beta testers using it daily

## Quick Wins (Can Do Anytime)

### Low-Hanging Fruit
- [ ] Add `repartee --version` command
- [ ] Add `repartee --health` command (check API keys, test connections)
- [ ] Add shell completion (bash, zsh, fish)
- [ ] Improve `--help` text with examples
- [ ] Add `repartee config` command to view/edit settings
- [ ] Add progress bars for long operations (importing vault, etc.)
- [ ] Color-code output (errors red, success green, info blue)

### Nice-to-Haves

- [ ] Add `repartee benchmark` command (test API latency)
- [ ] Export conversations to Markdown
- [ ] Add keyboard interrupt handling (Ctrl+C cleanup)
- [ ] Cache API responses for repeated queries

## Common Issues to Fix

### Issue 1: Python 3.13 Requirement
**Problem**: Most users don't have Python 3.13 yet  
**Solution**: Relax to 3.11+ (test backwards compatibility)  
**Priority**: HIGH

### Issue 2: No Tests
**Problem**: Can't confidently make changes  
**Solution**: Add pytest, write unit tests, set up CI  
**Priority**: HIGH

### Issue 3: Poor Error Messages
**Problem**: Users see cryptic tracebacks  
**Solution**: Add try/except blocks, user-friendly messages  
**Priority**: MEDIUM

### Issue 4: Missing Docs
**Problem**: New users can't get started easily  
**Solution**: Write INSTALL.md, QUICKSTART.md, examples  
**Priority**: MEDIUM

### Issue 5: Placeholder Features
**Problem**: fzf_tui.py, textual_tui.py, repl.py are empty/minimal  
**Solution**: Complete them in Phase 2 (weeks 5-8)  
**Priority**: MEDIUM (not blocking, but important)

## How to Prioritize

### Must-Have (Block Release)
- Python 3.11+ support
- Logging system
- Error handling
- Basic tests (50%+ coverage)
- Installation docs

### Should-Have (Better UX)
- REPL mode
- TUI interface
- Conversation saving
- Better help text
- Demo video

### Nice-to-Have (Polish)

- Plugin system

## Resources Needed

### For Immediate Work (Month 1)
- **Time**: ~40 hours (10 hours/week for 4 weeks)
- **Tools**: Python 3.11-3.13, pytest, GitHub Actions (all free)
- **API Keys**: OpenAI/Anthropic for testing (~$10-20/month)
- **No other resources needed**

### For Full Roadmap (6 months)
- **Time**: ~250 hours total
- **Infrastructure**: Same as above
- **Beta Testers**: 5-10 people for feedback
- **Community**: Discord/GitHub Discussions (optional)

## Decision Framework

### When Adding Features, Ask:
1. **Does it differentiate us?** (Knowledge integration = yes, code gen = no)
2. **Does it improve core UX?** (Logging = yes, fancy UI = later)
3. **Can we maintain it?** (Simple > complex, fewer dependencies > more)
4. **Do users actually need it?** (Ask users, don't assume)

### When to Say No:
- Feature requests that compete with Aider/Continue.dev (code-specific)
- Enterprise features (SSO, compliance, etc.)
- Overly complex autonomous agent features
- Anything that requires significant infrastructure

### When to Say Yes:
- Knowledge integration improvements (Obsidian, Logseq, etc.)
- Memory/context enhancements
- Privacy/security features
- Plugin system and extensibility
- Quality-of-life improvements

## Measuring Success

### Weekly Check-In Questions
1. Did I ship something users can see/feel?
2. Did I fix bugs reported by users?
3. Did I make progress on the roadmap?
4. Did I document what I built?
5. Am I still excited about the vision?

### Monthly Milestones
- **Month 1**: Stable foundation (v0.3.0)
- **Month 2**: Polished UX (v0.4.0)
- **Month 3**: Knowledge integration (v0.5.0)
- **Month 4**: Privacy features (v0.6.0)
- **Month 5**: Plugin system (v0.7.0)
- **Month 6**: 1.0 release 🎉

### 6-Month Success Criteria
- [ ] 50+ weekly active users
- [ ] 500+ GitHub stars
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] <5 open bugs
- [ ] 3+ community plugins
- [ ] Featured in 1+ tech blog/newsletter

## Getting Help

### When Stuck on Technical Issues
1. Check Python/library documentation
2. Search existing GitHub issues
3. Ask on Python Discord/Stack Overflow
4. Open an issue for discussion

### When Stuck on Direction
1. Re-read docs/SUMMARY.md (this analysis)
2. Talk to users (what do they need?)
3. Review competitor features (what's missing?)
4. Remember the core vision: "AI that knows your knowledge"

### When Losing Motivation
1. Remember why you started (frustration with context-free AI)
2. Show progress to others (blog, Twitter, etc.)
3. Use the tool yourself (dogfooding)
4. Take a break (better than burnout)
5. Find a co-maintainer (share the load)

## Final Checklist for This Week

- [ ] Read all analysis docs (SUMMARY.md, PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md, ROADMAP.md)
- [ ] Lower Python version requirement to 3.11+
- [ ] Set up pytest infrastructure
- [ ] Implement basic logging
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Write at least 5 unit tests
- [ ] Update README with new positioning
- [ ] Tag and announce analysis completion

## What Success Looks Like (6 Months from Now)
