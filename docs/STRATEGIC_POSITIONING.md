**Positioning Statement**:
> "Repartee sits at the intersection of general-purpose AI assistance and personal knowledge management. It's more capable than a simple chat interface but more focused than coding-specific tools. It bridges the gap between your accumulated knowledge and AI's reasoning capabilities."

## Messaging Framework

### Tagline Options
1. **"AI that knows your knowledge"** (Current favorite)
2. "Your notes, amplified by AI"
3. "Context-aware AI for knowledge workers"
4. "The CLI assistant that reads your mind (and your notes)"
5. "Personal AI with institutional memory"

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
> "Repartee is a command-line AI assistant that integrates with your personal knowledge base. Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, which forget everything after each session, Repartee understands your notes, documents, and accumulated wisdom. Ask it anything, and it draws on both AI capabilities and your personal knowledge to give context-aware answers. It's like having an AI that's actually read all your notes."

### Detailed Description (2 minutes)
> "Imagine you've spent years building a personal knowledge base in Obsidian or Markdown files. You have research notes, project documentation, book summaries, and ideas spread across hundreds of files. When you ask a typical AI assistant a question, it has no idea this knowledge exists.
>
> Repartee changes that. It indexes your notes, builds a knowledge graph of concepts and connections, and automatically retrieves relevant information when you have a conversation. It's like ChatGPT, but with access to your entire personal knowledge base.
>
> And it's privacy-first. You can run it entirely locally with open-source models, or use cloud APIs when you need more power. Your knowledge stays on your machine unless you explicitly choose otherwise.
>
> Built by knowledge workers, for knowledge workers."

## Key Messages by Audience

### For PKM Enthusiasts
- **Message**: "Finally, an AI that can actually use your notes"
- **Evidence**: Obsidian integration, knowledge graph, semantic search
- **Call-to-action**: "Import your vault and see what AI can do when it knows your knowledge"

### For Privacy-Conscious Users
- **Message**: "AI assistance without sacrificing privacy"
- **Evidence**: Local models, local embeddings, privacy mode, open source
- **Call-to-action**: "Run it entirely on your hardware, zero cloud dependencies"

### For Developers
- **Message**: "Extensible, hackable, and respects the Unix philosophy"
- **Evidence**: Plugin system, MCP protocol, clean architecture, well-documented
- **Call-to-action**: "Build plugins, integrate with your workflow, make it yours"

### For Researchers
- **Message**: "AI research assistant that cites your sources"
- **Evidence**: Citation tracking, knowledge graph, semantic search, provenance
- **Call-to-action**: "Ask questions about your research and get answers backed by your own notes"

## Competitive Advantages

### 1. Knowledge Integration (Strongest)
**Why it matters**: AI is only as useful as the context it has. Most tools have no context.
**How to communicate**: Show before/after demos. "Generic answer" vs. "Answer using your notes"
**Proof points**: 
- Import 1000+ notes in under a minute
- Automatic context retrieval
- Knowledge graph visualization

### 2. Multi-layered Memory (Strong)
**Why it matters**: Conversations build on each other. Most tools forget everything.
**How to communicate**: "Repartee remembers so you don't have to"
**Proof points**:
- Short-term: current conversation
- Episodic: past conversations, searchable
- Semantic: structured knowledge, graph-based

### 3. Privacy & Local-First (Strong)
**Why it matters**: Trust issues with AI companies, regulatory compliance, data sovereignty
**How to communicate**: "Your data, your hardware, your control"
**Proof points**:
- Run 100% offline
- XDG-compliant, transparent data storage
- Privacy mode with guarantees

### 4. Multi-interface Flexibility (Medium)
**Why it matters**: Different tasks need different interfaces
**How to communicate**: "Works how you work"
**Proof points**:
- CLI for one-shots
- REPL for exploration
- TUI for deep work

### 5. Provider Agnostic (Medium)
**Why it matters**: Vendor lock-in is risky; best model changes over time
**How to communicate**: "Best model for every task"
**Proof points**:
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models
- Easy switching
- Cost tracking

## Anti-Positioning

### What Repartee is NOT:

1. **Not a coding assistant** (like Aider)
   - "If you need AI for code generation, use Aider. If you need AI that understands your project documentation, research notes, and design decisions, use Repartee."

2. **Not an autonomous agent** (like AutoGPT)
   - "Repartee augments your thinking; it doesn't replace you. It's a tool, not an employee."

3. **Not a chatbot replacement** (like ChatGPT)
   - "ChatGPT is great for general knowledge. Repartee is great for YOUR knowledge."

4. **Not enterprise software**
   - "Built for individuals, not IT departments. If you need SSO, compliance certifications, and enterprise support, this isn't it."

5. **Not a note-taking app**
   - "We don't compete with Obsidian. We make Obsidian (and other note apps) more powerful by adding AI on top."

## Content Strategy
