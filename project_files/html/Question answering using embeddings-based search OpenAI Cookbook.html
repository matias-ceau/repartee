space-y-6"><article class="prose prose-sm sm:prose-base max-w-none dark:prose-invert"><p>GPT excels at answering questions, but only on topics it remembers from its training data.</p>
<p>What should you do if you want GPT to answer questions about unfamiliar topics? E.g.,</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent events after Sep 2021</li>
<li>Your non-public documents</li>
<li>Information from past conversations</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This notebook demonstrates a two-step Search-Ask method for enabling GPT to answer questions using a library of reference text.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Search:</strong> search your library of text for relevant text sections</li>
<li><strong>Ask:</strong> insert the retrieved text sections into a message to GPT and ask it the question</li>
</ol></article><article class="prose prose-sm sm:prose-base max-w-none dark:prose-invert"><h2 id="why-search-is-better-than-fine-tuning"><a class="heading-link" href="#why-search-is-better-than-fine-tuning">Why search is better than fine-tuning</a></h2>
<p>GPT can learn knowledge in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Via model weights (i.e., fine-tune the model on a training set)</li>
<li>Via model inputs (i.e., insert the knowledge into an input message)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although fine-tuning can feel like the more natural option—training 
on data is how GPT learned all of its other knowledge, after all—we 
generally do not recommend it as a way to teach the model knowledge. 
Fine-tuning is better suited to teaching specialized tasks or styles, 
and is less reliable for factual recall.</p>
<p>As an analogy, model weights are like long-term memory. When you 
fine-tune a model, it's like studying for an exam a week away. When the 
exam arrives, the model may forget details, or misremember facts it 
never read.</p>
<p>In contrast, message inputs are like short-term memory. When you 
insert knowledge into a message, it's like taking an exam with open 
notes. With notes in hand, the model is more likely to arrive at correct
 answers.</p>
<p>One downside of text search relative to fine-tuning is that each 
model is limited by a maximum amount of text it can read at once:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Maximum text length</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code></td><td>4,096 tokens (~5 pages)</td></tr><tr><td><code>gpt-4</code></td><td>8,192 tokens (~10 pages)</td></tr><tr><td><code>gpt-4-32k</code></td><td>32,768 tokens (~40 pages)</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>(New model is available with longer contexts, gpt-4-1106-preview have 128K context window)</p>
<p>Continuing the analogy, you can think of the model like a student who
 can only look at a few pages of notes at a time, despite potentially 
having shelves of textbooks to draw upon.</p>
<p>Therefore, to build a system capable of drawing upon large quantities
 of text to answer questions, we recommend using a Search-Ask approach.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm sm:prose-base max-w-none dark:prose-invert"><h2 id="search"><a class="heading-link" href="#search">Search</a></h2>
<p>Text can be searched in many ways. E.g.,</p>
<ul>
<li>Lexical-based search</li>
<li>Graph-based search</li>
<li>Embedding-based search</li>
</ul>
<p>This example notebook uses embedding-based search. <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings">Embeddings</a> are simple to implement and work especially well with questions, as questions often don't lexically overlap with their answers.</p>
<p>Consider embeddings-only search as a starting point for your own 
system. Better search systems might combine multiple search methods, 
along with features like popularity, recency, user history, redundancy 
with prior search results, click rate data, etc. Q&amp;A retrieval 
performance may also be improved with techniques like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496">HyDE</a>,
 in which questions are first transformed into hypothetical answers 
before being embedded. Similarly, GPT can also potentially improve 
search results by automatically transforming questions into sets of 
keywords or search terms.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm sm:prose-base max-w-none dark:prose-invert"><h2 id="full-procedure"><a class="heading-link" href="#full-procedure">Full procedure</a></h2>
<p>Specifically, this notebook demonstrates the following procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare search data (once per document)<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Collect: We'll download a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Olympics</li>
<li>Chunk: Documents are split into short, mostly self-contained sections to be embedded</li>
<li>Embed: Each section is embedded with the OpenAI API</li>
<li>Store: Embeddings are saved (for large datasets, use a vector database)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Search (once per query)<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Given a user question, generate an embedding for the query from the OpenAI API</li>
<li>Using the embeddings, rank the text sections by relevance to the query</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Ask (once per query)<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Insert the question and the most relevant sections into a message to GPT</li>
<li>Return GPT's answer</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="costs"><a class="heading-link" href="#costs">Costs</a></h3>
<p>Because GPT is more expensive than embeddings search, a system with a
 decent volume of queries will have its costs dominated by step 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> using ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.002 per query, or ~500 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)</li>
<li>For <code>gpt-4</code>, again assuming ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.03 per query, or ~30 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, exact costs will depend on the system specifics and usage patterns.</p></article><article class="prose prose-sm sm:prose-base max-w-none dark:prose-invert"><h2 id="preamble"><a class="heading-link" href="#preamble">Preamble</a></h2>

<span class="line"><span style="color: #9ECBFF">The curling competitions of the 2022 Winter Olympics were held at the Beijing National Aquatics Centre, one of the Olympic Green venues. Curling competitions were scheduled for every day of the games, from February 2 to February 20.[1] This was the eighth time that curling was part of the Olympic program.</span></span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #9ECBFF">In each of the men's, women's, and mixed doubles competitions, 10 nations competed. The mixed doubles competition was expanded for its second appearance in the Olympics.[2] A total of 120 quota spots (60 per sex) were distributed to the sport of curling, an increase of four from the 2018 Winter Olympics.[3] A total of 3 events were contested, one for men, one for women, and one mixed.[4]</span></span>

<span class="line"><span style="color: #9ECBFF">Main article: Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #9ECBFF">Qualification to the Men's and Women's curling tournaments at the Winter Olympics was determined through two methods (in addition to the host nation). Nations qualified teams by placing in the top six at the 2021 World Curling Championships. Teams could also qualify through Olympic qualification events which were held in 2021. Six nations qualified via World Championship qualification placement, while three nations qualified through qualification events. In men's and women's play, a host will be selected for the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE). They would be joined by the teams which competed at the 2021 World Championships but did not qualify for the Olympics, and two qualifiers from the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event (Pre-OQE). The Pre-OQE was open to all member associations.[5]</span></span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #9ECBFF">For the mixed doubles competition in 2022, the tournament field was expanded from eight competitor nations to ten.[2] The top seven ranked teams at the 2021 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship qualified, along with two teams from the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE) – Mixed Doubles. This OQE was open to a nominated host and the fifteen nations with the highest qualification points not already qualified to the Olympics. As the host nation, China qualified teams automatically, thus making a total of ten teams per event in the curling tournaments.[6]</span></span>

Here are some of the effects:\n\n1. Changes in Qualification: The qualifying process for curling and women\'s ice hockey had to be altered due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020. Qualification for curling was based on placement in the 2021 World Curling Championships and an Olympic Qualification Event. The women\'s tournament qualification was based on existing IIHF World Rankings.\n\n2. Biosecurity Protocols: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced biosecurity protocols for the Games, which included a "closed-loop management system" where athletes had to remain within a bio-secure bubble. Athletes were required to undergo daily COVID-19 testing and could only travel to and from Games-related venues. Only residents of China were allowed to attend the Games as spectators.\n\n3. NHL Player Withdrawal: The National Hockey League (NHL) and National Hockey League Players\' Association (NHLPA) announced that NHL players would not participate in the men\'s hockey tournament due to concerns over COVID-19 and the need to make up postponed games.\n\n4. Limited Spectators: Ticket sales to the general public were canceled, and only limited numbers of spectators were admitted by invitation only. The Games were closed to the general public, with spectators only present at events held in Beijing and Zhangjiakou.\n\n5. Use of My2022 App: Everyone present at the Games, including athletes, staff, and attendees, were required to use the My2022 mobile app as part of the biosecurity protocols. The app was used for health reporting, COVID-19 vaccination and testing records, customs declarations, and messaging.\n\n6. Athlete Absences: Some top athletes, including Austrian ski jumper Marita Kramer and Russian skeletonist Nikita Tregubov, were unable to travel to China after testing positive for COVID-19, even if asymptomatic.\n\n7. COVID-19 Cases: There were a total of 437 COVID-19 cases linked to the 2022 Winter Olympics, with 171 cases among the COVID-19 protective bubble residents and the rest detected through airport testing of games-related arrivals.\n\nPlease note that this answer is based on the provided articles and may not include all possible impacts of COVID-19 on the 2022 Winter Olympics.'</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src="Question%20answering%20using%20embeddings-based%20search%20OpenAI%20Cookbook_files/webpack-37896819691f6437.js" crossorigin=""

When logprobs is enabled, the API returns the log probabilities of each output token, along with a limited number of the most likely tokens at each token position and their log probabilities. The relevant request parameters are:\nlogprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of message. This option is currently not available on the gpt-4-vision-preview model.\ntop_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.\n\nLog probabilities of output tokens indicate the likelihood of each token occurring in the sequence given the context. To simplify, a logprob is log(p), where p = probability of a token occurring at a specific position based on the previous tokens in the context. Some key points about logprobs:\nHigher log probabilities suggest a higher likelihood of the token in that context. This allows users to gauge the model's confidence in its output or explore alternative responses the model considered.\nLogprob can be any negative number or 0.0. 0.0 corresponds to 100% probability.\nLogprobs allow us to compute the joint probability of a sequence as the sum of the logprobs of the individual tokens. This is useful for scoring and ranking model outputs. Another common approach is to take the average per-token logprob of a sentence to choose the best generation.\nWe can examine the logprobs assigned to different candidate tokens to understand what options the model considered plausible or implausible.\n\nWhile there are a wide array of use cases for logprobs, this notebook will focus on its use for:\n\nClassification tasks\n\nLarge Language Models excel at many classification tasks, but accurately measuring the model's confidence in its outputs can be challenging. logprobs provide a probability associated with each class prediction, enabling users to set their own classification or confidence thresholds.\n\nRetrieval (Q\u0026A) evaluation\n\nlogprobs can assist with self-evaluation in retrieval applications. In the Q\u0026A example, the model outputs a contrived has_sufficient_context_for_answer boolean, which can serve as a confidence score of whether the answer is contained in the retrieved content. Evaluations of this type can reduce retrieval-based hallucinations and enhance accuracy.\n\nAutocomplete\nlogprobs could help us decide how to suggest words as a user is typing.\n\nToken highlighting and outputting bytes\nUsers can easily create a token highlighter using the built in tokenization that comes with enabling logprobs. Additionally, the bytes parameter includes the ASCII encoding of each output character, which is particularly useful for reproducing emojis and special characters.\n\nCalculating perplexity\nlogprobs can be used to help us assess the model's overall confidence in a result and help us compare the confidence of results from different prompts.\n0. Imports and utils\n1. Using logprobs to assess confidence for classification tasks\nLet's say we want to create a system to classify news articles into a set of pre-defined categories. Without logprobs, we can use Chat Completions to do this, but it is much more difficult to assess the certainty with which the model made its classifications.\n\nNow, with logprobs enabled, we can see exactly how confident the model is in its predictions, which is crucial for creating an accurate and trustworthy classifier. For example, if the log probability for the chosen category is high, this suggests the model is quite confident in its classification. If it's low, this suggests the model is less confident. This can be particularly useful in cases where the model's classification is not what you expected, or when the model's output needs to be reviewed or validated by a human.\nWe'll begin with a prompt that presents the model with four categories: Technology, Politics, Sports, and Arts. The model is then tasked with classifying articles into these categories based solely on their headlines.\nLet's look at three sample headlines, and first begin with a standard Chat Completions output, without logprobs\nHere we can see the selected category for each headline. However, we have no visibility into the confidence of the model in its predictions. Let's rerun the same prompt but with logprobs enabled, and top_logprobs set to 2 (this will show us the 2 most likely output tokens for each token). Additionally we can also output the linear probability of each output token, in order to convert the log probability to the more easily interprable scale of 0-100%.\nAs expected from the first two headlines, gpt-4 is nearly 100% confident in its classifications, as the content is clearly technology and politics focused respectively. However, the third headline combines both sports and art-related themes, so we see the model is less confident in its selection.\n\nThis shows how important using logprobs can be, as if we are using LLMs for classification tasks we can set confidence theshholds, or output several potential output tokens if the log probability of the selected output is not sufficiently high. For instance, if we are creating a recommendation engine to tag articles, we can automatically classify headlines crossing a certain threshold, and send the less certain headlines for manual review.\n2. Retrieval confidence scoring to reduce hallucinations\nTo reduce hallucinations, and the performance of our RAG-based Q\u0026A system, we can use logprobs to evaluate how confident the model is in its retrieval.\nLet's say we have built a retrieval system using RAG for Q\u0026A, but are struggling with hallucinated answers to our questions. Note: we will use a hardcoded article for this example, but see other entries in the cookbook for tutorials on using RAG for Q\u0026A.\nNow, what we can do is ask the model to respond to the question, but then also evaluate its response. Specifically, we will ask the model to output a boolean has_sufficient_context_for_answer. We can then evaluate the logprobs to see just how confident the model is that its answer was contained in the provided context\nFor the first two questions, our model asserts with (near) 100% confidence that the article has sufficient context to answer the posed questions.\nOn the other hand, for the more tricky questions which are less clearly answered in the article, the model is less confident that it has sufficient context. This is a great guardrail to help ensure our retrieved content is sufficient.\nThis self-evaluation can help reduce hallucinations, as you can restrict answers or re-prompt the user when your sufficient_context_for_answer log probability is below a certain threshold. Methods like this have been shown to significantly reduce RAG for Q\u0026A hallucinations and errors (Example)\n3. Autocomplete\nAnother use case for logprobs are autocomplete systems. Without creating the entire autocomplete system end-to-end, let's demonstrate how logprobs could help us decide how to suggest words as a user is typing.\nFirst, let's come up with a sample sentence: \"My least favorite TV show is Breaking Bad.\" Let's say we want it to dynamically recommend the next word or token as we are typing the sentence, but only if the model is quite sure of what the next word will be. To demonstrate this, let's break up the sentence into sequential components.\nNow, we can ask gpt-3.5-turbo to act as an autocomplete engine with whatever context the model is given. We can enable logprobs and can see how confident the model is in its prediction.\nLet's look at the high confidence autocompletions:\nThese look reasonable! We can feel confident in those suggestions. It's pretty likely you want to write 'show' after writing 'My least favorite TV'! Now let's look at the autocompletion suggestions the model was less confident about:\nThese are logical as well. It's pretty unclear what the user is going to say with just the prefix 'my least favorite', and it's really anyone's guess what the author's favorite TV show is.\nSo, using gpt-3.5-turbo, we can create the root of a dynamic autocompletion engine with logprobs!\n4. Highlighter and bytes parameter\nLet's quickly touch on creating a simple token highlighter with logprobs, and using the bytes parameter. First, we can create a function that counts and highlights each token. While this doesn't use the log probabilities, it uses the built in tokenization that comes with enabling logprobs.\nNext, let's reconstruct a sentence using the bytes parameter. With logprobs enabled, we are given both each token and the ASCII (decimal utf-8) values of the token string. These ASCII values can be helpful when handling tokens of or containing emojis or special characters.\nHere, we see that while the first token was \\xf0\\x9f\\x92', we can get its ASCII value and append it to a bytes array. Then, we can easily decode this array into a full sentence, and validate with our assert statement that the decoded bytes is the same as our completion message!\n\nAdditionally, we can get the joint probability of the entire completion, which is the exponentiated product of each token's log probability. This gives us how likely this given completion is given the prompt. Since, our prompt is quite directive (asking for a certain emoji and its name), the joint probability of this output is high! If we ask for a random output however, we'll see a much lower joint probability. This can also be a good tactic for developers during prompt engineering.\n5. Calculating perplexity\n\nWhen looking to assess the model's confidence in a result, it can be useful to calculate perplexity, which is a measure of the uncertainty. Perplexity can be calculated by exponentiating the negative of the average of the logprobs. Generally, a higher perplexity indicates a more uncertain result, and a lower perplexity indicates a more confident result. As such, perplexity can be used to both assess the result of an individual model run and also to compare the relative confidence of results between model runs. While a high confidence doesn't guarantee result accuracy, it can be a helpful signal that can be paired with other evaluation metrics to build a better understanding of your prompt's behavior.\n\nFor example, let's say that I want to use gpt-3.5-turbo to learn more about artificial intelligence. I could ask a question about recent history and a question about the future:\nIn this example, gpt-3.5-turbo returned a lower perplexity score for a more deterministic question about recent history, and a higher perplexity score for a more speculative assessment about the near future. Again, while these differences don't guarantee accuracy, they help point the way for our interpretation of the model's results and our future use of them.\n6. Conclusion\nNice! We were able to use the logprobs parameter to build a more robust classifier, evaluate our retrieval for Q\u0026A system, and encode and decode each 'byte' of our tokens! logprobs adds useful information and signal to our completions output, and we are excited to see how developers incorporate it to improve applications.\n7. Possible extensions\nThere are many other use cases for logprobs that are not covered in this cookbook.

Additionally, extracting insights from data and articulating them effectively on slides can be challenging.  This cookbook recipe will demonstrate how you can utilize the new Assistants API to facilitate the end to end slide creation process for you without you having to touch Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides, saving you valuable time and effort!\n0. Setup\n1. Creating the content\nIn this recipe, we will be creating a brief fictional presentation for the quarterly financial review of our company, NotReal Corporation. We want to highlight some key trends we are seeing that are affecting the profitability of our company. Let's say we have the some financial data at our disposal. Let's load in the data, and take a look...\nAs you can see, this data has quarterly revenue, costs and customer data across different distribution channels. Let's create an Assistant\nthat can act as a personal analyst and make a nice visualization for our PowerPoint!\nFirst, we need to upload our file so our Assistant can access it.\nNow, we're ready to create our Assistant. We can instruct our assistant to act as a data scientist, and take any queries we give it and run the necessary code to output the proper data visualization. The instructions parameter here is akin to system instructions in the ChatCompletions endpoint, and can help guide the assistant. We can also turn on the tool of Code Interpreter, so our Assistant will be able to code. Finally, we can specifiy any files we want to use, which in this case is just the financial_data file we created above.\nLet's create a thread now, and as our first request ask the Assistant to calculate quarterly profits, and then plot the profits by distribution channel over time. The assistant will automatically calculate the profit for each quarter, and also create a new column combining quarter and year, without us having to ask for that directly. We can also specify the colors of each line.\nNo we can execute the run of our thread\nWe can now start a loop that will check if the image has been created. Note: This may take a few minutes\nLet's see the messages the Assistant added.\nWe can see that the last message (latest message is shown first) from the assistant contains the image file we are looking for. An interesting note here is that the Assistant was able to attempt several times to parse the JSON data, as the first parsing was unsuccessful, demonstrating the assistant's adaptability.\nLet's load in the plot!\nThe Image\nNice! So, with just one sentence, we were able to have our assistant use code interpreter to\ncalculate the profitability, and graph the three lineplots of the various distribution channels.\nNow we have a nice visual for our slide, but we want some insights to go along with it.\n2. Generating insights\nTo get insights from our image, we simply need to add a new message to our thread. Our Assistant will know to use the message history to give us some concise takeaways from the visual provided.\nNow, once the run has completed, we can see the latest message\nCool! So our assistant was able to identify the noteworthy growth in Online Sales profit, and infer that this shows the importance of a large digital presence. Now let's get a compelling title for the slide.\nAnd the title is:\n3. DALL·E-3 title image\nNice, now we have a title, a plot and two bullet points. We're almost ready to put this all on a slide, but as a final step, let's have DALL·E-3 come up with an image to use as the title slide of the presentation.\nNote: DALL·E-3 is not yet available within the assistants API but is coming soon!\nWe'll feed in a brief description of our company (NotRealCorp) and have DALL·E-3 do the rest!\nCool, now we can add this image to our thread. First, we can save the image locally, then upload it to the assistants API using the File upload endpoint. Let's also take a look at our image\n\nImage\n4. Creating the slides\nWe now have all the content we need to create the slides. While we could simply add a message asking for slides, but let's instead give the assistant a slide template, using the python-pptx library, to use. This will ensure we get a deck in the style we want. See the Extensions section at the end of the notebook for notes on creating the template.\nLet's set a few quick variables for our slides. We want the company name, NotRealCorp, to be on the title slide, and the title of the presentation should 'Quartlerly financial planning metting, Q3, 2023'.\nAnd for the data slide, we have:\nHere we have a template to create a Title Slide. The template below was created by uploading the image of a desirable title slide to GPT-V, and asking for the python-pptx code to create that template. The inputs to the template are the image_path, title_text, and subtitle_text.\nNow, we have a PPTX file saved with all of our created content!.\nLet's look at the screenshots of the .pptx we just created using JUST the assistants API and DALL·E-3. We don't have a seed parameter yet in the Assistants API, so the DALL·E-3 image and wordings will be slightly different from what you see when you run this notebook, due to the non-determinism of LLMs, but the outputs should be directionally the same.\nThe title slide:\nTitle Slide\nAnd the data slide:\nData Slide\n5. Conclusion\nWoo! While these slides could use some formatting tweaks, we have made some great content using the Assistants API, GPT-4 and DALL·E-3. We were able to take a .csv file with financial data, and use our assisant to calculate profit by quarter across distribution channels, plot the results, identify insights and key takeaways from the visualization, and create a summarative title. And, given just a description of our company, NotRealCorp, we used DALL·E-3 to make an awesome title image.\nWhile we are still a ways away from entirely automating this process without a human in the loop, hopefully this notebook can make the slide creation process a bit easier for you. More importantly, this notebook can ideally give you a glimpse into the potential of the assistants API! We're excited to see what you build.\n6. Extensions\nWhen  DALL·E-3 is incorporated in the Assistants API, we will have the ability to request the generated title image within the thread.\nGPT-4-Vision is not yet supported in the Assistants API, but could have been used to gather insights from the line plot image.\nGPT-4-Vision was used to generate the python-pptx template included in this recipe, so a potential extension project could be demonstrating best practices around converting images to slide templates."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"18:Tcb1,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis notebook serves as a tool to preprocess and analyze the chat dataset used for fine-tuning a chat model.\nIt checks for format errors, provides basic statistics, and estimates token counts for fine-tuning costs.\nThe method shown here corresponds to the current fine-tuning method for gpt-3.5-turbo.\nSee legacy fine-tuning for models like babbage-002 and davinci-002.\nData loading\n\nWe first load the chat dataset from an example JSONL file.\nFormat validation\n\nWe can perform a variety of error checks to validate that each conversation in the dataset adheres to the format expected by the fine-tuning API. Errors are categorized based on their nature for easier debugging.\n\nData Type Check: Checks whether each entry in the dataset is a dictionary (dict). Error type: data_type.\nPresence of Message List: Checks if a messages list is present in each entry. Error type: missing_messages_list.\nMessage Keys Check: Validates that each message in the messages list contains the keys role and content. Error type: message_missing_key.\nUnrecognized Keys in Messages: Logs if a message has keys other than role, content, weight, function_call, and name. Error type: message_unrecognized_key.\nRole Validation: Ensures the role is one of \"system\", \"user\", or \"assistant\". Error type: unrecognized_role.\nContent Validation: Verifies that content has textual data and is a string. Error type: missing_content.\nAssistant Message Presence: Checks that each conversation has at least one message from the assistant. Error type: example_missing_assistant_message.\n\nThe code below performs these checks, and outputs counts for each type of error found are printed. This is useful for debugging and ensuring the dataset is ready for the next steps.\n\nToken Counting Utilities\n\nLets define a few helpful utilities to be used in the rest of the notebook.\nData Warnings and Token Counts\n\nWith some lightweight analysis we can identify potential issues in the dataset, like missing messages, and provide statistical insights into message and token counts.\n\nMissing System/User Messages: Counts the number of conversations missing a \"system\" or \"user\" message. Such messages are critical for defining the assistant's behavior and initiating the conversation.\nNumber of Messages Per Example: Summarizes the distribution of the number of messages in each conversation, providing insight into dialogue complexity.\nTotal Tokens Per Example: Calculates and summarizes the distribution of the total number of tokens in each conversation. Important for understanding fine-tuning costs.\nTokens in Assistant's Messages: Calculates the number of tokens in the assistant's messages per conversation and summarizes this distribution. Useful for understanding the assistant's verbosity.\nToken Limit Warnings: Checks if any examples exceed the maximum token limit (4096 tokens), as such examples will be truncated during fine-tuning, potentially resulting in data loss.\n\nCost Estimation\n\nIn this final section, we estimate the total number of tokens that will be used for fine-tuning, which allows us to approximate the cost. It is worth noting that the duration of the fine-tuning jobs will also increase with the token count.\nSee https://openai.com/pricing to estimate total costs."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"19:T4a2,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThere are many ways to classify text. This notebook shares an example of text classification using embeddings. For many text classification tasks, we've seen fine-tuned models do better than embeddings.

We also recommend having more examples than embedding dimensions, which we don't quite achieve here.\n\nIn this text classification task, we predict the score of a food review (1 to 5) based on the embedding of the review's text. We split the dataset into a training and a testing set for all the following tasks, so we can realistically evaluate performance on unseen data. The dataset is created in the Get_embeddings_from_dataset Notebook.\n\nWe can see that the model has learnt to distinguish between the categories decently. 5-star reviews show the best performance overall, and this is not too surprising, since they are the most common in the dataset.\nUnsurprisingly 5-star and 1-star reviews seem to be easier to predict. Perhaps with more data, the nuances between 2-4 stars could be better predicted, but there's also probably more subjectivity in how people use the inbetween scores."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1a:T5ef,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis notebook covers use cases where your data is unlabelled but has features that can be used to cluster them into meaningful categories.

We can then use these to apply labels to a previously unlabelled dataset.\n\nTo feed the model we use embeddings created using the approach displayed in the notebook Multiclass classification for transactions Notebook, applied to the full 359 transactions in the dataset to give us a bigger pool for learning\nSetup\nClustering\n\nWe'll reuse the approach from the Clustering Notebook, using K-Means to cluster our dataset using the feature embeddings we created previously.

Looking at the visualisation some of our clusters have some overlap and we'll need some tuning to get to the right place, but already we can see that GPT-3 has made some effective inferences. In particular, it picked up that items including legal deposits were related to literature archival, which is true but the model was given no clues on.

For this demonstration, we use our own openai-python code repository. We implement a simple version of file parsing and extracting of functions from python files, which can be embedded, indexed, and queried.\nHelper Functions\n\nWe first setup some simple parsing functions that allow us to extract important information from our codebase.\nData Loading\n\nWe'll first load the openai-python folder and extract the needed information using the functions we defined above.\nNow that we have our content, we can pass the data to the text-embedding-3-small model and get back our vector embeddings.\nTesting\n\nLet's test our endpoint with some simple queries. If you're familiar with the openai-python repository, you'll see that we're able to easily find functions we're looking for only a simple English description.\n\nWe define a search_functions method that takes our data that contains our embeddings, a query string, and some other configuration options. The process of searching our database works like such:\n\nWe first embed our query string (code_query) with text-embedding-3-small. The reasoning here is that a query string like 'a function that reverses a string' and a function like 'def reverse(string): return string[::-1]' will be very similar when embedded.\nWe then calculate the cosine similarity between our query string embedding and all data points in our database. This gives a distance between each point and our query.\nWe finally sort all of our data points by their distance to our query string and return the number of results requested in the function parameters."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1c:Te31,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis notebook demonstrates one way to customize OpenAI embeddings to a particular task.\n\nThe input is training data in the form of [text_1, text_2, label] where label is +1 if the pairs are similar and -1 if the pairs are dissimilar.\n\nThe output is a matrix that you can use to multiply your embeddings. The product of this multiplication is a 'custom embedding' that will better emphasize aspects of the text relevant to your use case. In binary classification use cases, we've seen error rates drop by as much as 50%.\n\nIn the following example, I use 1,000 sentence pairs picked from the SNLI corpus. Each pair of sentences are logically entailed (i.e., one implies the other). These pairs are our positives (label = 1). We generate synthetic negatives by combining sentences from different pairs, which are presumed to not be logically entailed (label = -1).\n\nFor a clustering use case, you can generate positives by creating pairs from texts in the same clusters and generate negatives by creating pairs from sentences in different clusters.\n\nWith other data sets, we have seen decent improvement with as little as ~100 training examples. Of course, performance will be better with  more examples.\n0. Imports\n1. Inputs\n\nMost inputs are here. The key things to change are where to load your datset from, where to save a cache of embeddings to, and which embedding engine you want to use.\n\nDepending on how your data is formatted, you'll want to rewrite the process_input_data function.\n2. Load and process input data\n3. Split data into training test sets\n\nNote that it's important to split data into training and test sets before generating synethetic negatives or positives. You don't want any text strings in the training data to show up in the test data. If there's contamination, the test metrics will look better than they'll actually be in production.\n4. Generate synthetic negatives\n\nThis is another piece of the code that you will need to modify to match your use case.\n\nIf you have data with positives and negatives, you can skip this section.\n\nIf you have data with only positives, you can mostly keep it as is, where it generates negatives only.\n\nIf you have multiclass data, you will want to generate both positives and negatives. The positives can be pairs of text that share labels, and the negatives can be pairs of text that do not share labels.\n\nThe final output should be a dataframe with text pairs, where each pair is labeled -1 or 1.\n5. Calculate embeddings and cosine similarities\n\nHere, I create a cache to save the embeddings. This is handy so that you don't have to pay again if you want to run the code again.\n6. Plot distribution of cosine similarity\n\nHere we measure similarity of text using cosine similarity. In our experience, most distance functions (L1, L2, cosine similarity) all work about the same. Note that our embeddings are already normalized to length 1, so cosine similarity is equivalent to dot product.\n\nThe graphs show how much the overlap there is between the distribution of cosine similarities for similar and dissimilar pairs. If there is a high amount of overlap, that means there are some dissimilar pairs with greater cosine similarity than some similar pairs.\n\nThe accuracy I compute is the accuracy of a simple rule that predicts 'similar (1)' if the cosine similarity is above some threshold X and otherwise predicts 'dissimilar (0)'.\n7.

The maximum length varies by model, and is measured by tokens, not string length. If you are unfamiliar with tokenization, check out How to count tokens with tiktoken.\n\nThis notebook shows how to handle texts that are longer than a model's maximum context length. We'll demonstrate using embeddings from text-embedding-3-small, but the same ideas can be applied to other models and tasks. To learn more about embeddings, check out the OpenAI Embeddings Guide.\n\n1. Model context length\n\nFirst, we select the model and define a function to get embeddings from the API.\nThe text-embedding-3-small model has a context length of 8191 tokens with the cl100k_base encoding, and we can see that going over that limit causes an error.\nClearly we want to avoid these errors, particularly when handling programmatically with a large number of embeddings. Yet, we still might be faced with texts that are longer than the maximum context length. Below we describe and provide recipes for the main approaches to handling these longer texts: (1) simply truncating the text to the maximum allowed length, and (2) chunking the text and embedding each chunk individually.\n1. Truncating the input text\n\nThe simplest solution is to truncate the input text to the maximum allowed length. Because the context length is measured in tokens, we have to first tokenize the text before truncating it. The API accepts inputs both in the form of text or tokens, so as long as you are careful that you are using the appropriate encoding, there is no need to convert the tokens back into string form. Below is an example of such a truncation function.\nOur example from before now works without error.\n2. Chunking the input text\n\nThough truncation works, discarding potentially relevant text is a clear drawback. Another approach is to divide the input text into chunks and then embed each chunk individually. Then, we can either use the chunk embeddings separately, or combine them in some way, such as averaging (weighted by the size of each chunk).\n\nWe will take a function from Python's own cookbook that breaks up a sequence into chunks.\nNow we define a function that encodes a string into tokens and then breaks it up into chunks.\nFinally, we can write a function that safely handles embedding requests, even when the input text is longer than the maximum context length, by chunking the input tokens and embedding each chunk individually. The average flag can be set to True to return the weighted average of the chunk embeddings, or False to simply return the unmodified list of chunk embeddings.\nOnce again, we can now handle long input texts.\nIn some cases, it may make sense to split chunks on paragraph boundaries or sentence boundaries to help preserve the meaning of the text."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1f:T885,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nGPT-3 can help us extract key figures, dates or other bits of important content from documents that are too big to fit into the context window.

First we will look at the data itself:\nOne sample from the baseball category can be seen above. It is an email to a mailing list. We can observe that we have 1197 examples in total, which are evenly split between the two sports.\nData Preparation\nWe transform the dataset into a pandas dataframe, with a column for prompt and completion. The prompt contains the email from the mailing list, and the completion is a name of the sport, either hockey or baseball. For demonstration purposes only and speed of fine-tuning we take only 300 examples. In a real use case the more examples the better the performance.\nBoth baseball and hockey are single tokens. We save the dataset as a jsonl file.\nData Preparation tool\nWe can now use a data preparation tool which will suggest a few improvements to our dataset before fine-tuning. Before launching the tool we update the openai library to ensure we're using the latest data preparation tool. We additionally specify -q which auto-accepts all suggestions.\nThe tool helpfully suggests a few improvements to the dataset and splits the dataset into training and validation set.\n\nA suffix between a prompt and a completion is necessary to tell the model that the input text has stopped, and that it now needs to predict the class. Since we use the same separator in each example, the model is able to learn that it is meant to predict either baseball or hockey following the separator.\nA whitespace prefix in completions is useful, as most word tokens are tokenized with a space prefix.\nThe tool also recognized that this is likely a classification task, so it suggested to split the dataset into training and validation datasets. This will allow us to easily measure expected performance on new data.\nFine-tuning\nThe tool suggests we run the following command to train the dataset. Since this is a classification task, we would like to know what the generalization performance on the provided validation set is for our classification use case.\n\nWe can simply copy the suggested command from the CLI tool. We specifically add -m ada to fine-tune a cheaper and faster ada model, which is usually comperable in performance to slower and more expensive models on classification use cases.\nThe model is successfully trained in about ten minutes. You can watch the finetune happen on https://platform.openai.com/finetune/\n\nYou can also check on its status programatically:\n[Advanced] Results and expected model performance\nWe can now download the results file to observe the expected performance on a held out validation set.\nThe accuracy reaches 99.6%. On the plot below we can see how accuracy on the validation set increases during the training run.\nUsing the model\nWe can now call the model to get the predictions.\nWe need to use the same separator following the prompt which we used during fine-tuning. In this case it is \\n\\n###\\n\\n. Since we're concerned with classification, we want the temperature to be as low as possible, and we only require one token completion to determine the prediction of the model.\nTo get the log probabilities, we can specify logprobs parameter on the completion request\nWe can see that the model predicts hockey as a lot more likely than baseball, which is the correct prediction. By requesting log_probs, we can see the prediction (log) probability for each class.\nGeneralization\nInterestingly, our fine-tuned classifier is quite versatile. Despite being trained on emails to different mailing lists, it also successfully predicts tweets."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"21:T16d8,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis notebook is centered around the integration of the Google Places API and custom user profiles to enhance location-based searches. Our approach involves using the Google Places API in combination with user preferences, aiming to make location discovery more personal and relevant. Please note that while we focus on the Google Places API in this instance, there are numerous other APIs you could explore and apply in a similar fashion.\n\nWe'll explore the application of three main components:\n\nCustomer profile: This mock profile captures individual preferences for types of places (e.g., restaurants, parks, museums), budget, preferred ratings, and other specific requirements.\n\nGoogle Places API: This API provides real-time data about nearby places. It factors in various data points such as ratings, types of venues, costs, and more from the locations around you.\n\nFunction calling: A single command such as \"I'm hungry\" or \"I want to visit a museum\" activates the function which combines the user profile data and Google Places API to identify suitable venues.\n\nThis notebook introduces two primary use cases:\n\nProfile-based recommendations: Learn how to create a user profile and make place recommendations based on individual preferences.\n\nAPI integration with function calling: Understand how to integrate and call Google Places API effectively to source real-time data of various places using function calling.\n\nPlease note that while this system is highly versatile, its effectiveness may vary based on user preferences and available place data. For the purposes of this notebook, the customer data is fake and the location is hardcoded.\nSetup\n\nGoogle Places API\n\nTo use the Google Places API, you'll need two things:\n\nGoogle Account: If you don't already have one, you will need to create a Google account.\n\nGoogle Places API Key: The API key is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes. You can get your API key from the Google Cloud Console.\n\nPlease note that Google Places API is a paid service, and the cost is associated with the number of API calls made. Keep track of your usage to avoid any unexpected charges.\n\n\n\nThe requests library is also needed, you can download it by using the following command:\n\npip install requests\nIn this code snippet, we are defining a function fetch_customer_profile that accepts a user_id and returns a mock user profile.\n\nThis function simulates an API call that fetches user data from a database. For this demo, we're using hard-coded data. The user profile contains various details such as the user's location (set to the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge for this example), preferences in food and activities, app usage metrics, recent interactions, and user rank.\n\nIn a production environment, you would replace this hard-coded data with a real API call to your user database.\n\nRequesting and processing data from Google Places API\n\nThe function call_google_places_api serves to request information from the Google Places API and provide a list of the top two places based on a given place_type and optional food_preference. We've limited this function to the top two results to manage usage since this is a paid service. However, you can modify this to retrieve any number of results as per your requirement.\n\nThe function is configured with a hardcoded location (set to the coordinates of the Transamerica Pyramid), your Google API key, and specific request parameters. Depending on the place_type, it formulates the appropriate API request URL. If the place_type is a restaurant and a food_preference is specified, it is included in the API request.\n\nAfter sending the GET request, the function checks the response status. If it's successful, it processes the JSON response, extracts the relevant details using the get_place_details function, and returns them in a human-readable format. If the request fails, it prints out the error for debugging.\n\nThe get_place_details function is used to retrieve more detailed information about a place, given its place_id. It sends a GET request to the Google Place Details API and returns the result if the request is successful. If the request fails, it prints out the error for debugging.\n\nBoth functions handle exceptions and return an error message if something goes wrong.\nGenerating user-specific recommendations with GPT-3.5-Turbo and Google Places API\n\nThe function provide_user_specific_recommendations interacts with GPT-3.5-Turbo and the Google Places API to provide responses tailored to a user's preferences and location.\n\nFirst, it fetches the customer's profile using their user_id. If no profile is found, it returns an error message.\n\nWith a valid profile, it extracts the customer's food preferences and then interacts with the OpenAI model. It provides an initial system message, giving context to the AI model about its role, user preferences, and the usage of the Google Places API function.\n\nThe user input is also sent to the model as a message, and the function call_google_places_api is defined in the functions parameter for the AI model to call as needed.\n\nFinally, it processes the model's response. If the model makes a function call to the Google Places API, the function is executed with the appropriate arguments, and the names of nearby places are returned. If there are no such places or the request isn't understood, appropriate error messages are returned.\n\nExecuting user-specific recommendations\n\nUpon execution, the function fetches the user's profile, interacts with the AI model, processes the model's response, calls the Google Places API if necessary, and ultimately returns a list of recommendations tailored to the user's preferences and location. The printed output would consist of these personalized recommendations."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"22:T159a,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis notebook takes you through how to use LangChain to augment an OpenAI model with access to external tools. In particular, you'll be able to create LLM agents that use custom tools to answer user queries.\n\nWhat is Langchain?\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. Their framework enables you to build layered LLM-powered applications that are context-aware and able to interact dynamically with their environment as agents, leading to simplified code for you and a more dynamic user experience for your customers.\n\nWhy do LLMs need to use Tools?\nOne of the most common challenges with LLMs is overcoming the lack of recency and specificity in their training data - answers can be out of date, and they are prone to hallucinations given the huge variety in their knowledge base. Tools are a great method of allowing an LLM to answer within a controlled context that draws on your existing knowledge bases and internal APIs - instead of trying to prompt engineer the LLM all the way to your intended answer, you allow it access to tools that it calls on dynamically for info, parses, and serves to customer.\n\nProviding LLMs access to tools can enable them to answer questions with context directly from search engines, APIs or your own databases. Instead of answering directly, an LLM with access to tools can perform intermediate steps to gather relevant information. Tools can also be used in combination. For example, a language model can be made to use a search tool to lookup quantitative information and a calculator to execute calculations.\n\nNotebook Sections\n\nSetup:** Import packages and connect to a Pinecone vector database.\nLLM Agent:** Build an agent that leverages a modified version of the ReAct framework to do chain-of-thought reasoning.\nLLM Agent with History:** Provide the LLM with access to previous steps in the conversation.\nKnowledge Base:** Create a knowledge base of \"Stuff You Should Know\" podcast episodes, to be accessed through a tool.\nLLM Agent with Tools:** Extend the agent with access to multiple tools and test that it uses them to answer questions.\nSetup\n\nImport libraries and set up a connection to a Pinecone vector database.\n\nYou can substitute Pinecone for any other vectorstore or database - there are a selection that are supported by Langchain natively, while other connectors will need to be developed yourself.\nFor acquiring an API key to connect with Pinecone, you can set up a free account and store it in the api_key variable below or in your environment variables under PINECONE_API_KEY\nRun this code block if you want to clear the index, or if the index doesn't exist yet\n\nCheck whether the index with the same name already exists - if so, delete it\nif index_name in pinecone.list_indexes():\n    pinecone.delete_index(index_name)\n\nCreates new index\npinecone.create_index(name=index_name, dimension=1536)\nindex = pinecone.Index(index_name=index_name)\n\nConfirm our index was created\npinecone.list_indexes()\nLLM Agent\n\nAn LLM agent in Langchain has many configurable components, which are detailed in the Langchain documentation.\n\nWe'll employ a few of the core concepts to make an agent that talks in the way we want, can use tools to answer questions, and uses the appropriate language model to power the conversation.\nPrompt Template:** The input template to control the LLM's behaviour and how it accepts inputs and produces outputs - this is the brain that drives your application (docs).\nOutput Parser:** A method of parsing the output from the prompt.

Agents can be extended with your own logic to allow retries, error handling and any other methods you choose to add reliability to your application (docs).\n\nNB: Before using this cookbook with the Search tool you'll need to sign up on https://serpapi.com/ and generate an API key.

The purpose of this is to enable models to generate function arguments which adhere to the provided specifications. Note that the API will not actually execute any function calls. It is up to developers to execute function calls using model outputs.\n\nWithin the tools parameter, if the functions parameter is provided then by default the model will decide when it is appropriate to use one of the functions. The API can be forced to use a specific function by setting the tool_choice parameter to {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"my_function\"}}. The API can also be forced to not use any function by setting the tool_choice parameter to \"none\". If a function is used, the output will contain \"finish_reason\": \"tool_calls\" in the response, as well as a tool_calls object that has the name of the function and the generated function arguments.\n\nOverview\n\nThis notebook contains the following 2 sections:\n\nHow to generate function arguments:** Specify a set of functions and use the API to generate function arguments.\nHow to call functions with model generated arguments:** Close the loop by actually executing functions with model generated arguments.\nHow to generate function arguments\nUtilities\n\nFirst let's define a few utilities for making calls to the Chat Completions API and for maintaining and keeping track of the conversation state.\nBasic concepts\n\nLet's create some function specifications to interface with a hypothetical weather API. We'll pass these function specification to the Chat Completions API in order to generate function arguments that adhere to the specification.\nIf we prompt the model about the current weather, it will respond with some clarifying questions.\nOnce we provide the missing information, it will generate the appropriate function arguments for us.\nBy prompting it differently, we can get it to target the other function we've told it about.\nOnce again, the model is asking us for clarification because it doesn't have enough information yet. In this case it already knows the location for the forecast, but it needs to know how many days are required in the forecast.\nForcing the use of specific functions or no function\nWe can force the model to use a specific function, for example get_n_day_weather_forecast by using the function_call argument. By doing so, we force the model to make assumptions about how to use it.\nWe can also force the model to not use a function at all. By doing so we prevent it from producing a proper function call.\nParallel Function Calling\n\nNewer models such as gpt-4o or gpt-3.5-turbo can call multiple functions in one turn.\nHow to call functions with model generated arguments\n\nIn our next example, we'll demonstrate how to execute functions whose inputs are model-generated, and use this to implement an agent that can answer questions for us about a database. For simplicity we'll use the Chinook sample database.\n\nNote: SQL generation can be high-risk in a production environment since models are not perfectly reliable at generating correct SQL.\nSpecifying a function to execute SQL queries\n\nFirst let's define some helpful utility functions to extract data from a SQLite database.\nNow can use these utility functions to extract a representation of the database schema.\nAs before, we'll define a function specification for the function we'd like the API to generate arguments for. Notice that we are inserting the database schema into the function specification. This will be important for the model to know about.\nExecuting SQL queries\n\nNow let's implement the function that will actually excute queries against the database.\nSteps to invoke a function call using Chat Completions API:\n\nStep 1: Prompt the model with content that may result in model selecting a tool to use. The description of the tools such as a function names and signature is defined in the 'Tools' list and passed to the model in API call. If selected, the function name and parameters are included in the response.\n\nStep 2: Check programmatically if model wanted to call a function. If true, proceed to step 3.\nStep 3: Extract the function name and parameters from response, call the function with parameters. Append the result to messages.\nStep 4: Invoke the chat completions API with the message list to get the response.\nNext Steps\n\nSee our other notebook that demonstrates how to use the Chat Completions API and functions for knowledge retrieval to interact conversationally with a knowledge base."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"25:T10bc,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\ntiktoken is a fast open-source tokenizer by OpenAI.\n\nGiven a text string (e.g., \"tiktoken is great!\") and an encoding (e.g., \"cl100k_base\"), a tokenizer can split the text string into a list of tokens (e.g., [\"t\", \"ik\", \"token\", \" is\", \" great\", \"!\"]).\n\nSplitting text strings into tokens is useful because GPT models see text in the form of tokens. Knowing how many tokens are in a text string can tell you (a) whether the string is too long for a text model to process and (b) how much an OpenAI API call costs (as usage is priced by token).\n\nEncodings\n\nEncodings specify how text is converted into tokens. Different models use different encodings.\n\ntiktoken supports three encodings used by OpenAI models:\n\n| Encoding name           | OpenAI models                                       |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| cl100k_base           | gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large  |\n| p50k_base             | Codex models, text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003|\n| r50k_base (or gpt2) | GPT-3 models like davinci                         |\n\nYou can retrieve the encoding for a model using tiktoken.encoding_for_model() as follows:\nencoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model('gpt-3.5-turbo')\n\nNote that p50k_base overlaps substantially with r50k_base, and for non-code applications, they will usually give the same tokens.\n\nTokenizer libraries by language\n\nFor cl100k_base and p50k_base encodings:\nPython: tiktoken\n.NET / C#: SharpToken, TiktokenSharp\nJava: jtokkit\nGolang: tiktoken-go\nRust: tiktoken-rs\n\nFor r50k_base (gpt2) encodings, tokenizers are available in many languages.\nPython: tiktoken (or alternatively GPT2TokenizerFast)\nJavaScript: gpt-3-encoder\n.NET / C#: GPT Tokenizer\nJava: gpt2-tokenizer-java\nPHP: GPT-3-Encoder-PHP\nGolang: tiktoken-go\nRust: tiktoken-rs\n\n(OpenAI makes no endorsements or guarantees of third-party libraries.)\n\nHow strings are typically tokenized\n\nIn English, tokens commonly range in length from one character to one word (e.g., \"t\" or \" great\"), though in some languages tokens can be shorter than one character or longer than one word. Spaces are usually grouped with the starts of words (e.g., \" is\" instead of \"is \" or \" \"+\"is\"). You can quickly check how a string is tokenized at the OpenAI Tokenizer, or the third-party Tiktokenizer webapp.\n0. Install tiktoken\n\nIf needed, install tiktoken with pip:\n1. Import tiktoken\n2. Load an encoding\n\nUse tiktoken.get_encoding() to load an encoding by name.\n\nThe first time this runs, it will require an internet connection to download. Later runs won't need an internet connection.\nUse tiktoken.encoding_for_model() to automatically load the correct encoding for a given model name.\n3. Turn text into tokens with encoding.encode()\n\n\nThe .encode() method converts a text string into a list of token integers.\nCount tokens by counting the length of the list returned by .encode().\n4. Turn tokens into text with encoding.decode()\n.decode() converts a list of token integers to a string.\nWarning: although .decode() can be applied to single tokens, beware that it can be lossy for tokens that aren't on utf-8 boundaries.\nFor single tokens, .decode_single_token_bytes() safely converts a single integer token to the bytes it represents.\n(The b in front of the strings indicates that the strings are byte strings.)\n5. Comparing encodings\n\nDifferent encodings vary in how they split words, group spaces, and handle non-English characters. Using the methods above, we can compare different encodings on a few example strings.\n6. Counting tokens for chat completions API calls\n\nChatGPT models like gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 use tokens in the same way as older completions models, but because of their message-based formatting, it's more difficult to count how many tokens will be used by a conversation.\n\nBelow is an example function for counting tokens for messages passed to gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4.\n\nNote that the exact way that tokens are counted from messages may change from model to model. Consider the counts from the function below an estimate, not a timeless guarantee.\n\nIn particular, requests that use the optional functions input will consume extra tokens on top of the estimates calculated below."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"26:T11fe,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis notebook provides a step-by-step guide for our new gpt-3.5-turbo fine-tuning. We'll perform entity extraction using the RecipeNLG dataset, which provides various recipes and a list of extracted generic ingredients for each. This is a common dataset for named entity recognition (NER) tasks.\n\nWe will go through the following steps:\n\nSetup: Loading our dataset and filtering down to one domain to fine-tune on.\nData preparation: Preparing your data for fine-tuning by creating training and validation examples, and uploading them to the Files endpoint.\nFine-tuning: Creating your fine-tuned model.\nInference: Using your fine-tuned model for inference on new inputs.\n\nBy the end of this you should be able to train, evaluate and deploy a fine-tuned gpt-3.5-turbo model.\n\nFor more information on fine-tuning, you can refer to our documentation guide, API reference or blog post\nSetup\n\nFine-tuning works best when focused on a particular domain. It's important to make sure your dataset is both focused enough for the model to learn, but general enough that unseen examples won't be missed. Having this in mind, we have extracted a subset from the RecipesNLG dataset to only contain documents from www.cookbooks.com.\nData preparation\n\nWe'll begin by preparing our data. When fine-tuning with the ChatCompletion format, each training example is a simple list of messages. For example, an entry could look like:\n\n[{'role': 'system',\n  'content': 'You are a helpful recipe assistant. You are to extract the generic ingredients from each of the recipes provided.'},\n\n {'role': 'user',\n  'content': 'Title: No-Bake Nut Cookies\\n\\nIngredients: [\"1 c. firmly packed brown sugar\", \"1/2 c. evaporated milk\", \"1/2 tsp. vanilla\", \"1/2 c. broken nuts (pecans)\", \"2 Tbsp. butter or margarine\", \"3 1/2 c. bite size shredded rice biscuits\"]\\n\\nGeneric ingredients: '},\n\n {'role': 'assistant',\n  'content': '[\"brown sugar\", \"milk\", \"vanilla\", \"nuts\", \"butter\", \"bite size shredded rice biscuits\"]'}]\n\nDuring the training process this conversation will be split, with the final entry being the completion that the model will produce, and the remainder of the messages acting as the prompt. Consider this when building your training examples - if your model will act on multi-turn conversations, then please provide representative examples so it doesn't perform poorly when the conversation starts to expand.\n\nPlease note that currently there is a 4096 token limit for each training example. Anything longer than this will be truncated at 4096 tokens.\n\nLet's now do this for a subset of the dataset to use as our training data. You can begin with even 30-50 well-pruned examples. You should see performance continue to scale linearly as you increase the size of the training set, but your jobs will also take longer.\nIn addition to training data, we can also optionally provide validation data, which will be used to make sure that the model does not overfit your training set.\nWe then need to save our data as .jsonl files, with each line being one training example conversation.\n\nThis is what the first 5 lines of our training .jsonl file look like:\nUpload files\n\nYou can now upload the files to our Files endpoint to be used by the fine-tuned model.\n\nFine-tuning\n\nNow we can create our fine-tuning job with the generated files and an optional suffix to identify the model. The response will contain an id which you can use to retrieve updates on the job.\n\nNote: The files have to first be processed by our system, so you might get a File not ready error. In that case, simply retry a few minutes later.\n\nCheck job status\n\nYou can make a GET request to the https://api.openai.com/v1/alpha/fine-tunes endpoint to list your alpha fine-tune jobs. In this instance you'll want to check that the ID you got from the previous step ends up as status: succeeded.\n\nOnce it is completed, you can use the result_files to sample the results from the validation set (if you uploaded one), and use the ID from the fine_tuned_model parameter to invoke your trained model.\n\nWe can track the progress of the fine-tune with the events endpoint. You can rerun the cell below a few times until the fine-tune is ready.\n\nNow that it's done, we can get a fine-tuned model ID from the job:\n\nInference\nThe last step is to use your fine-tuned model for inference. Similar to the classic FineTuning, you simply call ChatCompletions with your new fine-tuned model name filling the model parameter.\n\nConclusion\n\nCongratulations, you are now ready to fine-tune your own models using the ChatCompletion format!

For details, see the documentation, API reference, or the Cookbook guide How to call functions with chat models.\n\nTypically, a conversation will start with a system message that tells the assistant how to behave, followed by alternating user and assistant messages, but you are not required to follow this format.\n\nLet's look at an example chat API calls to see how the chat format works in practice.\nAs you can see, the response object has a few fields:\nid: the ID of the request\nchoices: a list of completion objects (only one, unless you set n greater than 1)\n    finish_reason: the reason the model stopped generating text (either stop, or length if max_tokens limit was reached)\n    index: The index of the choice in the list of choices.\n    logprobs: Log probability information for the choice.\n    message: the message object generated by the model\n        content: content of message\n        role: The role of the author of this message.\n        tool_calls: The tool calls generated by the model, such as function calls. if the tools is given\ncreated: the timestamp of the request\nmodel: the full name of the model used to generate the response\nobject: the type of object returned (e.g., chat.completion)\nsystem_fingerprint: This fingerprint represents the backend configuration that the model runs with.\nusage: the number of tokens used to generate the replies, counting prompt, completion, and total\nExtract just the reply with:\nEven non-conversation-based tasks can fit into the chat format, by placing the instruction in the first user message.\n\nFor example, to ask the model to explain asynchronous programming in the style of the pirate Blackbeard, we can structure conversation as follows:\n3. Tips for instructing gpt-3.5-turbo-0301\n\nBest practices for instructing models may change from model version to model version. The advice that follows applies to gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 and may not apply to future models.\nSystem messages\n\nThe system message can be used to prime the assistant with different personalities or behaviors.\n\nBe aware that gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 does not generally pay as much attention to the system message as gpt-4-0314 or gpt-3.5-turbo-0613. Therefore, for gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, we recommend placing important instructions in the user message instead. Some developers have found success in continually moving the system message near the end of the conversation to keep the model's attention from drifting away as conversations get longer.\nFew-shot prompting\n\nIn some cases, it's easier to show the model what you want rather than tell the model what you want.\n\nOne way to show the model what you want is with faked example messages.\n\nFor example:\nTo help clarify that the example messages are not part of a real conversation, and shouldn't be referred back to by the model, you can try setting the name field of system messages to example_user and example_assistant.\n\nTransforming the few-shot example above, we could write:\nNot every attempt at engineering conversations will succeed at first.\n\nIf your first attempts fail, don't be afraid to experiment with different ways of priming or conditioning the model.\n\nAs an example, one developer discovered an increase in accuracy when they inserted a user message that said \"Great job so far, these have been perfect\" to help condition the model into providing higher quality responses.\n\nFor more ideas on how to lift the reliability of the models, consider reading our guide on techniques to increase reliability. It was written for non-chat models, but many of its principles still apply.\n4. Counting tokens\n\nWhen you submit your request, the API transforms the messages into a sequence of tokens.\n\nThe number of tokens used affects:\nthe cost of the request\nthe time it takes to generate the response\nwhen the reply gets cut off from hitting the maximum token limit (4,096 for gpt-3.5-turbo or 8,192 for gpt-4)\n\nYou can use the following function to count the number of tokens that a list of messages will use.\n\nNote that the exact way that tokens are counted from messages may change from model to model. Consider the counts from the function below an estimate, not a timeless guarantee.\n\nIn particular, requests that use the optional functions input will consume extra tokens on top of the estimates calculated below.\n\nRead more about counting tokens in How to count tokens with tiktoken."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"28:T1b64,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nWhen you call the OpenAI API repeatedly, you may encounter error messages that say 429: 'Too Many Requests' or RateLimitError. These error messages come from exceeding the API's rate limits.\n\nThis guide shares tips for avoiding and handling rate limit errors.\n\nTo see an example script for throttling parallel requests to avoid rate limit errors, see api_request_parallel_processor.py.\n\nWhy rate limits exist\n\nRate limits are a common practice for APIs, and they're put in place for a few different reasons.\n\nFirst, they help protect against abuse or misuse of the API. For example, a malicious actor could flood the API with requests in an attempt to overload it or cause disruptions in service. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can prevent this kind of activity.\nSecond, rate limits help ensure that everyone has fair access to the API. If one person or organization makes an excessive number of requests, it could bog down the API for everyone else. By throttling the number of requests that a single user can make, OpenAI ensures that everyone has an opportunity to use the API without experiencing slowdowns.\nLastly, rate limits can help OpenAI manage the aggregate load on its infrastructure. If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can help maintain a smooth and consistent experience for all users.\n\nAlthough hitting rate limits can be frustrating, rate limits exist to protect the reliable operation of the API for its users.\nDefault rate limits\n\nYour rate limit and spending limit (quota) are automatically adjusted based on a number of factors. As your usage of the OpenAI API goes up and you successfully pay the bill, we automatically increase your usage tier. You can find specific information regarding rate limits using the resources below.\n\nOther rate limit resources\n\nRead more about OpenAI's rate limits in these other resources:\n\nGuide: Rate limits\nHelp Center: Is API usage subject to any rate limits?\nHelp Center: How can I solve 429: 'Too Many Requests' errors?\n\nRequesting a rate limit increase\n\nIf you'd like your organization's rate limit increased, please visit your Limits settings page to see how you can increase your usage tier\n\nExample rate limit error\n\nA rate limit error will occur when API requests are sent too quickly. If using the OpenAI Python library, they will look something like:\n\nRateLimitError: Rate limit reached for default-codex in organization org-{id} on requests per min. Limit: 20.000000 / min. Current: 24.000000 / min. Contact support@openai.com if you continue to have issues or if you’d like to request an increase.\n\nBelow is example code for triggering a rate limit error.\nHow to avoid rate limit errors\n\nRetrying with exponential backoff\n\nOne easy way to avoid rate limit errors is to automatically retry requests with a random exponential backoff. Retrying with exponential backoff means performing a short sleep when a rate limit error is hit, then retrying the unsuccessful request. If the request is still unsuccessful, the sleep length is increased and the process is repeated. This continues until the request is successful or until a maximum number of retries is reached.\n\nThis approach has many benefits:\n\nAutomatic retries means you can recover from rate limit errors without crashes or missing data\nExponential backoff means that your first retries can be tried quickly, while still benefiting from longer delays if your first few retries fail\nAdding random jitter to the delay helps retries from all hitting at the same time\n\nNote that unsuccessful requests contribute to your per-minute limit, so continuously resending a request won’t work.\n\nBelow are a few example solutions.\nExample #1: Using the Tenacity library\n\nTenacity is an Apache 2.0 licensed general-purpose retrying library, written in Python, to simplify the task of adding retry behavior to just about anything.\n\nTo add exponential backoff to your requests, you can use the tenacity.retry decorator. The following example uses the tenacity.wait_random_exponential function to add random exponential backoff to a request.\n\nNote that the Tenacity library is a third-party tool, and OpenAI makes no guarantees about its reliability or security.\nExample #2: Using the backoff library\n\nAnother library that provides function decorators for backoff and retry is backoff.\n\nLike Tenacity, the backoff library is a third-party tool, and OpenAI makes no guarantees about its reliability or security.\nExample 3: Manual backoff implementation\n\nIf you don't want to use third-party libraries, you can implement your own backoff logic.\nHow to maximize throughput of batch processing given rate limits\n\nIf you're processing real-time requests from users, backoff and retry is a great strategy to minimize latency while avoiding rate limit errors.\n\nHowever, if you're processing large volumes of batch data, where throughput matters more than latency, there are a few other things you can do in addition to backoff and retry.\n\nProactively adding delay between requests\n\nIf you are constantly hitting the rate limit, then backing off, then hitting the rate limit again, then backing off again, it's possible that a good fraction of your request budget will be 'wasted' on requests that need to be retried. This limits your processing throughput, given a fixed rate limit.\n\nHere, one potential solution is to calculate your rate limit and add a delay equal to its reciprocal (e.g., if your rate limit 20 requests per minute, add a delay of 3–6 seconds to each request). This can help you operate near the rate limit ceiling without hitting it and incurring wasted requests.\n\nExample of adding delay to a request\n\nBatching requests\n\nThe OpenAI API has separate limits for requests per minute and tokens per minute.\n\nIf you're hitting the limit on requests per minute, but have headroom on tokens per minute, you can increase your throughput by batching multiple tasks into each request. This will allow you to process more tokens per minute, especially with the smaller models.\n\nSending in a batch of prompts works exactly the same as a normal API call, except that pass in a list of strings to prompt parameter instead of a single string.\n\nWarning: the response object may not return completions in the order of the prompts, so always remember to match responses back to prompts using the index field.\n\nExample without batching\nExample with batching\nExample parallel processing script\n\nWe've written an example script for parallel processing large quantities of API requests: api_request_parallel_processor.py.\n\nThe script combines some handy features:\nStreams requests from file, to avoid running out of memory for giant jobs\nMakes requests concurrently, to maximize throughput\nThrottles both request and token usage, to stay under rate limits\nRetries failed requests, to avoid missing data\nLogs errors, to diagnose problems with requests\n\nFeel free to use it as is or modify it to suit your needs."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"29:Tc2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nBy default, when you request a completion from the OpenAI, the entire completion is generated before being sent back in a single response.\n\nIf you're generating long completions, waiting for the response can take many seconds.\n\nTo get responses sooner, you can 'stream' the completion as it's being generated. This allows you to start printing or processing the beginning of the completion before the full completion is finished.\n\nTo stream completions, set stream=True when calling the chat completions or completions endpoints. This will return an object that streams back the response as data-only server-sent events. Extract chunks from the delta field rather than the message field.\n\nDownsides\n\nNote that using stream=True in a production application makes it more difficult to moderate the content of the completions, as partial completions may be more difficult to evaluate. This may have implications for approved usage.\n\nExample code\n\nBelow, this notebook shows:\nWhat a typical chat completion response looks like\nWhat a streaming chat completion response looks like\nHow much time is saved by streaming a chat completion\nHow to get token usage data for streamed chat completion response\n1. What a typical chat completion response looks like\n\nWith a typical ChatCompletions API call, the response is first computed and then returned all at once.\nThe reply can be extracted with response.choices[0].message.\n\nThe content of the reply can be extracted with response.choices[0].message.content.\n2. How to stream a chat completion\n\nWith a streaming API call, the response is sent back incrementally in chunks via an event stream. In Python, you can iterate over these events with a for loop.\n\nLet's see what it looks like:\nAs you can see above, streaming responses have a delta field rather than a message field. delta can hold things like:\na role token (e.g., {\"role\": \"assistant\"})\na content token (e.g., {\"content\": \"\\n\\n\"})\nnothing (e.g., {}), when the stream is over\n3. How much time is saved by streaming a chat completion\n\nNow let's ask gpt-3.5-turbo to count to 100 again, and see how long it takes.\nTime comparison\n\nIn the example above, both requests took about 4 to 5 seconds to fully complete. Request times will vary depending on load and other stochastic factors.\n\nHowever, with the streaming request, we received the first token after 0.1 seconds, and subsequent tokens every ~0.01-0.02 seconds.\n4. How to get token usage data for streamed chat completion response\n\nYou can get token usage statistics for your streamed response by setting stream_options={\"include_usage\": True}. When you do so, an extra chunk will be streamed as the final chunk. You can access the usage data for the entire request via the usage field on this chunk. A few important notes when you set stream_options={\"include_usage\": True}:\nThe value for the usage field on all chunks except for the last one will be null.\nThe usage field on the last chunk contains token usage statistics for the entire request.\nThe choices field on the last chunk will always be an empty array [].\n\nLet's see how it works using the example in 2."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2a:T1449,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nFor this notebook we will be looking to classify a public dataset of transactions into a number of categories that we have predefined. These approaches should be replicable to any multiclass classification use case where we are trying to fit transactional data into predefined categories, and by the end of running through this you should have a few approaches for dealing with both labelled and unlabelled datasets.\n\nThe different approaches we'll be taking in this notebook are:\nZero-shot Classification:** First we'll do zero shot classification to put transactions in one of five named buckets using only a prompt for guidance\nClassification with Embeddings:** Following this we'll create embeddings on a labelled dataset, and then use a traditional classification model to test their effectiveness at identifying our categories\nFine-tuned Classification:** Lastly we'll produce a fine-tuned model trained on our labelled dataset to see how this compares to the zero-shot and few-shot classification approaches\nSetup\nLoad dataset\n\nWe're using a public transaction dataset of transactions over £25k for the Library of Scotland. The dataset has three features that we'll be using:\nSupplier: The name of the supplier\nDescription: A text description of the transaction\nValue: The value of the transaction in GBP\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://data.nls.uk/data/organisational-data/transactions-over-25k/\nZero-shot Classification\n\nWe'll first assess the performance of the base models at classifying these transactions using a simple prompt. We'll provide the model with 5 categories and a catch-all of \"Could not classify\" for ones that it cannot place.\nOur first attempt is correct, M \u0026 J Ballantyne Ltd are a house builder and the work they performed is indeed Building Improvement.\n\nLets expand the sample size to 25 and see how it performs, again with just a simple prompt to guide it\nInitial results are pretty good even with no labelled examples! The ones that it could not classify were tougher cases with few clues as to their topic, but maybe if we clean up the labelled dataset to give more examples we can get better performance.\nClassification with Embeddings\n\nLets create embeddings from the small set that we've classified so far - we've made a set of labelled examples by running the zero-shot classifier on 101 transactions from our dataset and manually correcting the 15 Could not classify results that we got\n\nCreate embeddings\n\nThis initial section reuses the approach from the Get_embeddings_from_dataset Notebook to create embeddings from a combined field concatenating all of our features\nUse embeddings for classification\n\nNow that we have our embeddings, let see if classifying these into the categories we've named gives us any more success.\n\nFor this we'll use a template from the Classification_using_embeddings notebook\nPerformance for this model is pretty strong, so creating embeddings and using even a simpler classifier looks like an effective approach as well, with the zero-shot classifier helping us do the initial classification of the unlabelled dataset.\n\nLets take it one step further and see if a fine-tuned model trained on this same labelled datasets gives us comparable results\nFine-tuned Transaction Classification\n\nFor this use case we're going to try to improve on the few-shot classification from above by training a fine-tuned model on the same labelled set of 101 transactions and applying this fine-tuned model on group of unseen transactions\nBuilding Fine-tuned Classifier\n\nWe'll need to do some data prep first to get our data ready. This will take the following steps:\nFirst we'll list out our classes and replace them with numeric identifiers. Making the model predict a single token rather than multiple consecutive ones like 'Building Improvement' should give us better results\nWe also need to add a common prefix and suffix to each example to aid the model in making predictions - in our case our text is already started with 'Supplier' and we'll add a suffix of '\\n\\n###\\n\\n'\nLastly we'll aid a leading whitespace onto each of our target classes for classification, again to aid the model\nApplying Fine-tuned Classifier\n\nNow we'll apply our classifier to see how it performs. We only had 31 unique observations in our training set and 8 in our validation set, so lets see how the performance is\nPerformance is not great - unfortunately this is expected. With only a few examples of each class, the above approach with embeddings and a traditional classifier worked better.\n\nA fine-tuned model works best with a great number of labelled observations. If we had a few hundred or thousand we may get better results, but lets do one last test on a holdout set to confirm that it doesn't generalise well to a new set of observations\nWell those results were similarly underwhelming - so we've learned that with a dataset with a small number of labelled observations, either zero-shot classification or traditional classification with embeddings return better results than a fine-tuned model.\n\nA fine-tuned model is still a great tool, but is more effective when you have a larger number of labelled examples for each class that you're looking to classify"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2b:Te4f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nSearching for relevant information can sometimes feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, but don’t despair, GPTs can actually do a lot of this work for us. In this guide we explore a way to augment existing search systems with various AI techniques, helping us sift through the noise.\n\nTwo ways of retrieving information for GPT are:\n\nMimicking Human Browsing: GPT triggers a search, evaluates the results, and modifies the search query if necessary. It can also follow up on specific search results to form a chain of thought, much like a human user would do.\nRetrieval with Embeddings: Calculate embeddings for your content and a user query, and then retrieve the content most related as measured by cosine similarity. This technique is used heavily by search engines like Google.\n\nThese approaches are both promising, but each has their shortcomings: the first one can be slow due to its iterative nature and the second one requires embedding your entire knowledge base in advance, continuously embedding new content and maintaining a vector database.\n\nBy combining these approaches, and drawing inspiration from re-ranking methods, we identify an approach that sits in the middle. This approach can be implemented on top of any existing search system, like the Slack search API, or an internal ElasticSearch instance with private data. Here’s how it works:\n\nsearch_augmented_by_query_generation_and_embeddings_reranking.png\n\nStep 1: Search\n\nUser asks a question.\nGPT generates a list of potential queries.\nSearch queries are executed in parallel.\n\nStep 2: Re-rank\n\nEmbeddings for each result are used to calculate semantic similarity to a generated hypothetical ideal answer to the user question.\nResults are ranked and filtered based on this similarity metric.\n\nStep 3: Answer\n\nGiven the top search results, the model generates an answer to the user’s question, including references and links.\n\nThis hybrid approach offers relatively low latency and can be integrated into any existing search endpoint, without requiring the upkeep of a vector database. Let's dive into it! We will use the News API as an example domain to search over.\n\nSetup\n\nIn addition to your OPENAI_API_KEY, you'll have to include a NEWS_API_KEY in your environment. You can get an API key here.\n\n1. Search\n\nIt all starts with a user question.\n\nNow, in order to be as exhaustive as possible, we use the model to generate a list of diverse queries based on this question.\n\nThe queries look good, so let's run the searches.\n\nAs we can see, oftentimes, the search queries will return a large number of results, many of which are not relevant to the original question asked by the user. In order to improve the quality of the final answer, we use embeddings to re-rank and filter the results.\n\n2. Re-rank\n\nDrawing inspiration from HyDE (Gao et al.), we first generate a hypothetical ideal answer to rerank our compare our results against. This helps prioritize results that look like good answers, rather than those similar to our question. Here’s the prompt we use to generate our hypothetical answer.\n\nNow, let's generate embeddings for the search results and the hypothetical answer. We then calculate the cosine distance between these embeddings, giving us a semantic similarity metric. Note that we can simply calculate the dot product in lieu of doing a full cosine similarity calculation since the OpenAI embeddings are returned normalized in our API.\n\nFinally, we use these similarity scores to sort and filter the results.\n\nAwesome! These results look a lot more relevant to our original query. Now, let's use the top 5 results to generate a final answer.\n\n3.

E.g.,\nRecent events after Sep 2021\nYour non-public documents\nInformation from past conversations\netc.\n\nThis notebook demonstrates a two-step Search-Ask method for enabling GPT to answer questions using a library of reference text.\n\nSearch: search your library of text for relevant text sections\nAsk: insert the retrieved text sections into a message to GPT and ask it the question\nWhy search is better than fine-tuning\n\nGPT can learn knowledge in two ways:\n\nVia model weights (i.e., fine-tune the model on a training set)\nVia model inputs (i.e., insert the knowledge into an input message)\n\nAlthough fine-tuning can feel like the more natural option—training on data is how GPT learned all of its other knowledge, after all—we generally do not recommend it as a way to teach the model knowledge. Fine-tuning is better suited to teaching specialized tasks or styles, and is less reliable for factual recall.\n\nAs an analogy, model weights are like long-term memory. When you fine-tune a model, it's like studying for an exam a week away. When the exam arrives, the model may forget details, or misremember facts it never read.\n\nIn contrast, message inputs are like short-term memory. When you insert knowledge into a message, it's like taking an exam with open notes. With notes in hand, the model is more likely to arrive at correct answers.\n\nOne downside of text search relative to fine-tuning is that each model is limited by a maximum amount of text it can read at once:\n\n| Model           | Maximum text length       |\n|-----------------|---------------------------|\n| gpt-3.5-turbo | 4,096 tokens (~5 pages)   |\n| gpt-4         | 8,192 tokens (~10 pages)  |\n| gpt-4-32k     | 32,768 tokens (~40 pages) |\n\n(New model is available with longer contexts, gpt-4-1106-preview have 128K context window)\n\nContinuing the analogy, you can think of the model like a student who can only look at a few pages of notes at a time, despite potentially having shelves of textbooks to draw upon.\n\nTherefore, to build a system capable of drawing upon large quantities of text to answer questions, we recommend using a Search-Ask approach.\n\nSearch\n\nText can be searched in many ways. E.g.,\n\nLexical-based search\nGraph-based search\nEmbedding-based search\n\nThis example notebook uses embedding-based search. Embeddings are simple to implement and work especially well with questions, as questions often don't lexically overlap with their answers.\n\nConsider embeddings-only search as a starting point for your own system. Better search systems might combine multiple search methods, along with features like popularity, recency, user history, redundancy with prior search results, click rate data, etc. Q\u0026A retrieval performance may also be improved with techniques like HyDE, in which questions are first transformed into hypothetical answers before being embedded. Similarly, GPT can also potentially improve search results by automatically transforming questions into sets of keywords or search terms.\nFull procedure\n\nSpecifically, this notebook demonstrates the following procedure:\n\nPrepare search data (once per document)\n    Collect: We'll download a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Olympics\n    Chunk: Documents are split into short, mostly self-contained sections to be embedded\n    Embed: Each section is embedded with the OpenAI API\n    Store: Embeddings are saved (for large datasets, use a vector database)\nSearch (once per query)\n    Given a user question, generate an embedding for the query from the OpenAI API\n    Using the embeddings, rank the text sections by relevance to the query\nAsk (once per query)\n    Insert the question and the most relevant sections into a message to GPT\n    Return GPT's answer\n\nCosts\n\nBecause GPT is more expensive than embeddings search, a system with a decent volume of queries will have its costs dominated by step 3.\n\nFor gpt-3.5-turbo using 1,000 tokens per query, it costs $0.002 per query, or ~500 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)\nFor gpt-4, again assuming 1,000 tokens per query, it costs $0.03 per query, or ~30 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)\n\nOf course, exact costs will depend on the system specifics and usage patterns.\nPreamble\n\nWe'll begin by:\nImporting the necessary libraries\nSelecting models for embeddings search and question answering\n\nTroubleshooting: Installing libraries\n\nIf you need to install any of the libraries above, run pip install {library_name} in your terminal.\n\nFor example, to install the openai library, run:\npip install openai\n\n(You can also do this in a notebook cell with !pip install openai or %pip install openai.)\n\nAfter installing, restart the notebook kernel so the libraries can be loaded.\n\nTroubleshooting: Setting your API key\n\nThe OpenAI library will try to read your API key from the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. If you haven't already, you can set this environment variable by following these instructions.\nMotivating example: GPT cannot answer questions about current events\n\nBecause the training data for gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 mostly ends in September 2021, the models cannot answer questions about more recent events, such as the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nFor example, let's try asking 'Which athletes won the gold medal in curling in 2022?':\nIn this case, the model has no knowledge of 2022 and is unable to answer the question.\n\nYou can give GPT knowledge about a topic by inserting it into an input message\n\nTo help give the model knowledge of curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics, we can copy and paste the top half of a relevant Wikipedia article into our message:\nThanks to the Wikipedia article included in the input message, GPT answers correctly.\n\nIn this particular case, GPT was intelligent enough to realize that the original question was underspecified, as there were three curling gold medal events, not just one.\n\nOf course, this example partly relied on human intelligence. We knew the question was about curling, so we inserted a Wikipedia article on curling.\n\nThe rest of this notebook shows how to automate this knowledge insertion with embeddings-based search.\n1. Prepare search data\n\nTo save you the time \u0026 expense, we've prepared a pre-embedded dataset of a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nTo see how we constructed this dataset, or to modify it yourself, see Embedding Wikipedia articles for search.\n2. Search\n\nNow we'll define a search function that:\nTakes a user query and a dataframe with text \u0026 embedding columns\nEmbeds the user query with the OpenAI API\nUses distance between query embedding and text embeddings to rank the texts\nReturns two lists:\n    The top N texts, ranked by relevance\n    Their corresponding relevance scores\n3. Ask\n\nWith the search function above, we can now automatically retrieve relevant knowledge and insert it into messages to GPT.\n\nBelow, we define a function ask that:\nTakes a user query\nSearches for text relevant to the query\nStuffs that text into a message for GPT\nSends the message to GPT\nReturns GPT's answer\nExample questions\n\nFinally, let's ask our system our original question about gold medal curlers:\nDespite gpt-3.5-turbo having no knowledge of the 2022 Winter Olympics, our search system was able to retrieve reference text for the model to read, allowing it to correctly list the gold medal winners in the Men's and Women's tournaments.\n\nHowever, it still wasn't quite perfect—the model failed to list the gold medal winners from the Mixed doubles event.\nTroubleshooting wrong answers\nTo see whether a mistake is from a lack of relevant source text (i.e., failure of the search step) or a lack of reasoning reliability (i.e., failure of the ask step), you can look at the text GPT was given by setting print_message=True.\n\nIn this particular case, looking at the text below, it looks like the #1 article given to the model did contain medalists for all three events, but the later results emphasized the Men's and Women's tournaments, which may have distracted the model from giving a more complete answer.\nKnowing that this mistake was due to imperfect reasoning in the ask step, rather than imperfect retrieval in the search step, let's focus on improving the ask step.\n\nThe easiest way to improve results is to use a more capable model, such as GPT-4. Let's try it.\nGPT-4 succeeds perfectly, correctly identifying all 12 gold medal winners in curling.\nMore examples\n\nBelow are a few more examples of the system in action. Feel free to try your own questions, and see how it does. In general, search-based systems do best on questions that have a simple lookup, and worst on questions that require multiple partial sources to be combined and reasoned about."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2d:T11e1,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nRecommendations are widespread across the web.\n\n'Bought that item? Try these similar items.'\n'Enjoy that book? Try these similar titles.'\n'Not the help page you were looking for? Try these similar pages.'\n\nThis notebook demonstrates how to use embeddings to find similar items to recommend. In particular, we use AG's corpus of news articles as our dataset.\n\nOur model will answer the question: given an article, what other articles are most similar to it?\n2. Load data\n\nNext, let's load the AG news data and see what it looks like.\nLet's take a look at those same examples, but not truncated by ellipses.\n3. Build cache to save embeddings\n\nBefore getting embeddings for these articles, let's set up a cache to save the embeddings we generate. In general, it's a good idea to save your embeddings so you can re-use them later. If you don't save them, you'll pay again each time you compute them again.\n\nThe cache is a dictionary that maps tuples of (text, model) to an embedding, which is a list of floats. The cache is saved as a Python pickle file.\nLet's check that it works by getting an embedding.\n4. Recommend similar articles based on embeddings\n\nTo find similar articles, let's follow a three-step plan:\nGet the similarity embeddings of all the article descriptions\nCalculate the distance between a source title and all other articles\nPrint out the other articles closest to the source title\n5. Example recommendations\n\nLet's look for articles similar to first one, which was about Tony Blair.\nPretty good! 4 of the 5 recommendations explicitly mention Tony Blair and the fifth is an article from London about climate change, topics that might be often associated with Tony Blair.\nLet's see how our recommender does on the second example article about NVIDIA's new chipset with more security.\nFrom the printed distances, you can see that the #1 recommendation is much closer than all the others (0.11 vs 0.14+). And the #1 recommendation looks very similar to the starting article - it's another article from PC World about increasing computer security. Pretty good!\nAppendix: Using embeddings in more sophisticated recommenders\n\nA more sophisticated way to build a recommender system is to train a machine learning model that takes in tens or hundreds of signals, such as item popularity or user click data. Even in this system, embeddings can be a very useful signal into the recommender, especially for items that are being 'cold started' with no user data yet (e.g., a brand new product added to the catalog without any clicks yet).\nAppendix: Using embeddings to visualize similar articles\nTo get a sense of what our nearest neighbor recommender is doing, let's visualize the article embeddings. Although we can't plot the 2048 dimensions of each embedding vector, we can use techniques like t-SNE or PCA to compress the embeddings down into 2 or 3 dimensions, which we can chart.\n\nBefore visualizing the nearest neighbors, let's visualize all of the article descriptions using t-SNE. Note that t-SNE is not deterministic, meaning that results may vary from run to run.\nAs you can see in the chart above, even the highly compressed embeddings do a good job of clustering article descriptions by category. And it's worth emphasizing: this clustering is done with no knowledge of the labels themselves!\n\nAlso, if you look closely at the most egregious outliers, they are often due to mislabeling rather than poor embedding. For example, the majority of the blue World points in the green Sports cluster appear to be Sports stories.\nNext, let's recolor the points by whether they are a source article, its nearest neighbors, or other.\nLooking at the 2D chart above, we can see that the articles about Tony Blair are somewhat close together inside of the World news cluster. Interestingly, although the 5 nearest neighbors (red) were closest in high dimensional space, they are not the closest points in this compressed 2D space. Compressing the embeddings down to 2 dimensions discards much of their information, and the nearest neighbors in the 2D space don't seem to be as relevant as those in the full embedding space.\nFor the chipset security example, the 4 closest nearest neighbors in the full embedding space remain nearest neighbors in this compressed 2D visualization. The fifth is displayed as more distant, despite being closer in the full embedding space.\nShould you want to, you can also make an interactive 3D plot of the embeddings with the function chart_from_components_3D. (Doing so will require recomputing the t-SNE components with n_components=3.)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2e:Te0e,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis notebook takes you through examples of using a cross-encoder to re-rank search results.\n\nThis is a common use case with our customers, where you've implemented semantic search using embeddings (produced using a bi-encoder) but the results are not as accurate as your use case requires. A possible cause is that there is some business rule you can use to rerank the documents such as how recent or how popular a document is.\n\nHowever, often there are subtle domain-specific rules that help determine relevancy, and this is where a cross-encoder can be useful. Cross-encoders are more accurate than bi-encoders but they don't scale well, so using them to re-order a shortened list returned by semantic search is the ideal use case.\n\nExample\n\nConsider a search task with D documents and Q queries.\n\nThe brute force approach of computing every pairwise relevance is expensive; its cost scales as\nA faster approach is embeddings-based search, in which an embedding is computed once for each document and query, and then re-used multiple times to cheaply compute pairwise relevance. Because embeddings are only computed once, its cost scales as\nAlthough embeddings-based search is faster, the quality can be worse. To get the best of both, one common approach is to use embeddings (or another bi-encoder) to cheaply identify top candidates, and then use GPT (or another cross-encoder) to expensively re-rank those top candidates. The cost of this hybrid approach scales as\nWalkthrough\n\nTo illustrate this approach we'll use\nThis notebook drew on this great article by Weaviate, and this excellent explanation of bi-encoders vs. cross-encoders from Sentence Transformers.\nSearch\n\nWe'll use the arXiv search service for this example, but this step could be performed by any search service you have.

Consider batching and parallel processing cross-encoder requests to process them more quickly.\n\nThe steps here are:\nBuild a prompt to assess relevance and provide few-shot examples to tune it to your domain.\nAdd a Return the classification of yes/no as well as the Rerank the results by the ## Conclusion\n\nWe've shown how to create a tailored cross-encoder to rerank academic papers. This approach will work best where there are domain-specific nuances that can be used to pick the most relevant corpus for your users, and where some pre-filtering has taken place to limit the amount of data the cross-encoder will need to process.\n\nA few typical use cases we've seen are:\nReturning a list of 100 most relevant stock reports, then re-ordering into a top 5 or 10 based on the detailed context of a particular set of customer portfolios\nRunning after a classic rules-based search that gets the top 100 or 1000 most relevant results to prune it according to a specific user's context\n\nTaking this forward\n\nTaking the few-shot approach, as we have here, can work well when the domain is general enough that a small number of examples will cover most reranking cases.

These include Digique Plus, CynapseFive, VortiQore V8, EchoNix Array, OrbitalLink Seven, and DigiFractal Matrix. We also spearhead several initiatives such as PULSE, RAPT, B.R.I.C.K., Q.U.A.R.T.Z., and F.L.I.N.T.\nWhisper transcribed our company name, product names, and miscapitalized our acronyms incorrectly. Let's pass the correct names as a list in the prompt.\nWhen passing the list of product names, some of the product names are transcribed correctly while others are still misspelled.\nYou can use GPT-4 to fix spelling mistakes\n\nLeveraging GPT-4 proves especially useful when the speech content is unknown beforehand and we have a list of product names readily available.\n\nThe post-processing technique using GPT-4 is notably more scalable than depending solely on Whisper's prompt parameter, which has a token limit of 244. GPT-4 allows us to process larger lists of correct spellings, making it a more robust method for handling extensive product lists.\n\nHowever, this post-processing technique isn't without limitations. It's constrained by the context window of the chosen model, which may pose challenges when dealing with vast numbers of unique terms. For instance, companies with thousands of SKUs may find that the context window of GPT-4 is insufficient to handle their requirements, and they might need to explore alternative solutions.\n\nInterestingly, the GPT-4 post-processing technique seems more reliable than using Whisper alone. This method, which leverages a product list, enhances the reliability of our results. However, this increased reliability comes at a price, as using this approach can increase costs and can result in higher latency.\nNow, let's input the original product list into GPT-4 and evaluate its performance. By doing so, we aim to assess the AI model's ability to correctly spell the proprietary product names, even with no prior knowledge of the exact terms to appear in the transcription. In our experiment, GPT-4 was successful in correctly spelling our product names, confirming its potential as a reliable tool for ensuring transcription accuracy.\nIn this case, we supplied a comprehensive product list that included all the previously used spellings, along with additional new names. This scenario simulates a real-life situation where we have a substantial SKU list and uncertain about the exact terms to appear in the transcription.

Fictitious prompts can be submitted to steer the model to use particular spellings or styles.\n\nThis notebook shares two techniques for using fictitious prompts to steer the model outputs:\n\nTranscript generation**: GPT can convert instructions into fictitious transcripts for Whisper to emulate.\nSpelling guide**: A spelling guide can tell the model how to spell names of people, products, companies, etc.\n\nThese techniques are not especially reliable, but can be useful in some situations.\n\nComparison with GPT prompting\n\nPrompting Whisper is not the same as prompting GPT. For example, if you submit an attempted instruction like \"Format lists in Markdown format\", the model will not comply, as it follows the style of the prompt, rather than any instructions contained within.\n\nIn addition, the prompt is limited to only 224 tokens. If the prompt is longer than 224 tokens, only the final 224 tokens of the prompt will be considered; all prior tokens will be silently ignored.

However, if we pass in a fictitious prompt of 'president biden' in lowercase, Whisper matches the style and generates a transcript in all lowercase.\nBe aware that when prompts are short, Whisper may be less reliable at following their style.\nLong prompts may be more reliable at steering Whisper.\nWhisper is also less likely to follow rare or odd styles.\nPass names in the prompt to prevent misspellings\n\nWhisper may incorrectly transcribe uncommon proper nouns such as names of products, companies, or people.\n\nWe'll illustrate with an example audio file full of product names.\nTo get Whisper to use our preferred spellings, let's pass the product and company names in the prompt, as a glossary for Whisper to follow.\nNow, let's switch to another audio recording authored specifically for this demonstration, on the topic of a odd barbecue.\n\nTo begin, we'll establish our baseline transcript using Whisper.\nWhile Whisper's transcription was accurate, it had to guess at various spellings.

Azure Cognitive Search) resource\nAzure Blob Storage resource\nYour documents to be used as data (See data source options)\n\n\nFor a full walk-through on how to upload your documents to blob storage and create an index using the Azure AI Studio, see this Quickstart.\nSetup\n\nFirst, we install the necessary dependencies.\nIn this example, we'll use dotenv to load our environment variables. To connect with Azure OpenAI and the Search index, the following variables should be added to a .env file in KEY=VALUE format:\n\nAZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT - the Azure OpenAI endpoint. This can be found under \"Keys and Endpoints\" for your Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure Portal.\nAZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY - the Azure OpenAI API key. This can be found under \"Keys and Endpoints\" for your Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure Portal. Omit if using Azure Active Directory authentication (see below Authentication using Microsoft Active Directory)\nSEARCH_ENDPOINT - the AI Search endpoint. This URL be found on the \"Overview\" of your Search resource on the Azure Portal.\nSEARCH_KEY - the AI Search API key. Found under \"Keys\" for your Search resource in the Azure Portal.\nSEARCH_INDEX_NAME - the name of the index you created with your own data.\nAuthentication\n\nThe Azure OpenAI service supports multiple authentication mechanisms that include API keys and Azure Active Directory token credentials.\nAuthentication using API key\n\nTo set up the OpenAI SDK to use an Azure API Key, we need to set api_key to a key associated with your endpoint (you can find this key in \"Keys and Endpoints\" under \"Resource Management\" in the Azure Portal). You'll also find the endpoint for your resource here.\nAuthentication using Azure Active Directory\nLet's now see how we can autheticate via Azure Active Directory. We'll start by installing the azure-identity library. This library will provide the token credentials we need to authenticate and help us build a token credential provider through the get_bearer_token_provider helper function. It's recommended to use get_bearer_token_provider over providing a static token to AzureOpenAI because this API will automatically cache and refresh tokens for you.\n\nFor more information on how to set up Azure Active Directory authentication with Azure OpenAI, see the documentation.\nNote: the AzureOpenAI infers the following arguments from their corresponding environment variables if they are not provided:\n\napi_key from AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY\nazure_ad_token from AZURE_OPENAI_AD_TOKEN\napi_version from OPENAI_API_VERSION\nazure_endpoint from AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\n\nChat completion model with your own data\nSetting the context\nIn this example, we want our model to base its responses on Azure AI services documentation data. Following the Quickstart shared previously, we have added the markdown file for the Azure AI services and machine learning documentation page to our search index. The model is now ready to answer questions about Azure AI services and machine learning.\nCode\nNow we can use Azure on your own data with Chat Completions. Providing our search endpoint, key, and index name in dataSources, any questions posed to the model will now be grounded in our own data. An additional property, context, will be provided in the response to show the data the model referenced to answer the question.\nIf you would prefer to stream the response from the model, you can pass the stream=True keyword argument:"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"38:T81c,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis example will cover embeddings using the Azure OpenAI service.\nSetup\n\nFirst, we install the necessary dependencies and import the libraries we will be using.\nAuthentication\n\nThe Azure OpenAI service supports multiple authentication mechanisms that include API keys and Azure Active Directory token credentials.\nAuthentication using API key\n\nTo set up the OpenAI SDK to use an Azure API Key, we need to set api_key to a key associated with your endpoint (you can find this key in \"Keys and Endpoints\" under \"Resource Management\" in the Azure Portal).

We explore traditional evaluation methods like ROUGE and BERTScore, in addition to showcasing a more novel approach using LLMs as evaluators.\n\nEvaluating the quality of summaries is a time-consuming process, as it involves different quality metrics such as coherence, conciseness, readability and content. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore and others are concrete and reliable, but they may not correlate well with the actual quality of summaries. They show relatively low correlation with human judgments, especially for open-ended generation tasks (Liu et al., 2023). There's a growing need to lean on human evaluations, user feedback, or model-based metrics while being vigilant about potential biases. While human judgment provides invaluable insights, it is often not scalable and can be cost-prohibitive.\n\nIn addition to these traditional metrics, we showcase a method (G-Eval) that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel, reference-free metric for assessing abstractive summaries. In this case, we use gpt-4 to score candidate outputs. gpt-4 has effectively learned an internal model of language quality that allows it to differentiate between fluent, coherent text and low-quality text. Harnessing this internal scoring mechanism allows auto-evaluation of new candidate outputs generated by an LLM.\n\nSetup\n\nExample task\n\nFor the purposes of this notebook we'll use the example summarization below.

First, broadly distributed benefits - any influence over AGI's deployment will be used for the benefit of all, and to avoid harmful uses or undue concentration of power. Second, long-term safety - OpenAI is committed to doing the research to make AGI safe, and to promote the adoption of such research across the AI community. Third, technical leadership - OpenAI aims to be at the forefront of AI capabilities. Fourth, a cooperative orientation - OpenAI actively cooperates with other research and policy institutions, and seeks to create a global community working together to address AGI's global challenges.\n\nSummaries:\n\n| Reference Summary /ref_summary (human generated)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Eval Summary 1 / eval_summary_1 (system generated)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Eval Summary 2 / eval_summary_2 (system generated)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| OpenAI aims to ensure artificial general intelligence (AGI) is used for everyone's benefit, avoiding harmful uses or undue power concentration.

It's a prevalent metric for evaluating automatic summarization tasks. Among its variants, ROUGE-L offers insights into the longest contiguous match between system-generated and reference summaries, gauging how well the system retains the original summary's essence.\n\nThe table shows the ROUGE scores for evaluating two different summaries against a reference text. In the case of rouge-1, Summary 2 outperforms Summary 1, indicating a better overlap of individual words and for rouge-l, Summary 2 has a higher score, implying a closer match in the longest common subsequences, and thus a potentially better overall summarization in capturing the main content and order of the original text. Since Summary 2 has many words and short phrases directly lifted from the excerpt, its overlap with the reference summary would likely be higher, leading to higher ROUGE scores.\n\nWhile ROUGE and similar metrics, such as BLEU and METEOR, offer quantitative measures, they often fail to capture the true essence of a well-generated summary. They also correlate worse with human scores. Given the advancements in LLMs, which are adept at producing fluent and coherent summaries, traditional metrics like ROUGE may inadvertently penalize these models. This is especially true if the summaries are articulated differently but still encapsulate the core information accurately.\n\nEvaluating using BERTScore\n\nROUGE relies on the exact presence of words in both the predicted and reference texts, failing to interpret the underlying semantics. This is where BERTScore comes in and leverages the contextual embeddings from the BERT model, aiming to evaluate the similarity between a predicted and a reference sentence in the context of machine-generated text. By comparing embeddings from both sentences, BERTScore captures semantic similarities that might be missed by traditional n-gram based metrics.\n\nThe close F1 Scores between the summaries indicate that they may perform similarly in capturing the key information. However, this small difference should be interpreted with caution. Since BERTScore may not fully grasp subtleties and high-level concepts that a human evaluator might understand, reliance solely on this metric could lead to misinterpreting the actual quality and nuances of the summary. An integrated approach combining BERTScore with human judgment and other metrics could offer a more reliable evaluation.\n\nEvaluating using GPT-4\n\nHere we implement an example reference-free text evaluator using gpt-4, inspired by the G-Eval) framework which evaluates the quality of generated text using large language models. Unlike metrics like ROUGE or BERTScore that rely on comparison to reference summaries, the gpt-4 based evaluator assesses the quality of generated content based solely on the input prompt and text, without any ground truth references. This makes it applicable to new datasets and tasks where human references are sparse or unavailable.\n\nHere's an overview of this method:\n\nWe define four distinct criteria:\n    Relevance: Evaluates if the summary includes only important information and excludes redundancies.\n    Coherence: Assesses the logical flow and organization of the summary.\n    Consistency: Checks if the summary aligns with the facts in the source document.\n    Fluency: Rates the grammar and readability of the summary.\nWe craft prompts for each of these criteria, taking the original document and the summary as inputs, and leveraging chain-of-thought generation and guiding the model to output a numeric score from 1-5 for each criteria.\nWe generate scores from gpt-4 with the defined prompts, comparing them across summaries.\n\nIn this demonstration, we're using a direct scoring function where gpt-4 generates a discrete score (1-5) for each metric. Normalizing the scores and taking a weighted sum could result in more robust, continuous scores that better reflect the quality and diversity of the summaries.\n\nOverall, the Summary 1 appears to outperform Summary 2 in three of the four categories (Coherence, Relevance and Fluency). Both summaries are found to be consistent with each other. The result might suggest that Summary 1 is generally preferable based on the given evaluation criteria.\n\nLimitations\n\nNote that LLM-based metrics could have a bias towards preferring LLM-generated texts over human-written texts. Additionally LLM based metrics are sensitive to system messages/prompts. We recommend experimenting with other techniques that can help improve performance and/or get consistent scores, striking the right balance between high-quality expensive evaluation and automated evaluations. It is also worth noting that this scoring methodology is currently limited by gpt-4's context window.\n\nConclusion\n\nEvaluating abstractive summarization remains an open area for further improvement. Traditional metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore provide useful automatic evaluation but have limitations in capturing semantic similarity and nuanced aspects of summarization quality. Moreover, they require reference outputs which can be expensive to collect/label. LLM-based metrics offer promise as a reference-free method of evaluating coherence, fluency, and relevance. However, they too have potential biases favoring text generated by LLMs. Ultimately, a combination of automatic metrics and human evaluation is ideal for reliably assessing abstractive summarization systems. While human evaluation is indispensable for gaining a comprehensive understanding of summary quality, it should be complemented with automated evaluation to enable efficient, large-scale testing. The field will continue to evolve more robust evaluation techniques, balancing quality, scalability, and fairness. Advancing evaluation methods is crucial for driving progress in production applications.\n\nReferences\n\nG-EVAL: NLG Evaluation Using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignment - Liu Y, Iter D, Xu Y, Wang S, Xu R, Zhu C.

Having strong evaluations (\"evals\") will mean a more stable, reliable application that is resilient to code and model changes. An eval is a task used to measure the quality of the output of an LLM or LLM system. Given an input prompt, an output is generated. We evaluate this output with a set of ideal answers and find the quality of the LLM system.\n\nImportance of Evaluations\n\nIf you are building with foundational models like GPT-4, creating high quality evals is one of the most impactful things you can do. Developing AI solutions involves an iterative design process. Without evals, it can be very difficult and time intensive to understand how different model versions and prompts might affect your use case.\n\nWith OpenAI’s continuous model upgrades, evals allow you to efficiently test model performance for your use cases in a standardized way. Developing a suite of evals customized to your objectives will help you quickly and effectively understand how new models may perform for your use cases. You can also make evals a part of your CI/CD pipeline to make sure you achieve the desired accuracy before deploying.\n\nTypes of evals\n\nThere are two main ways we can evaluate/grade completions: writing some validation logic in code\nor using the model itself to inspect the answer. We’ll introduce each with some examples.\n\nWriting logic for answer checking\n\nThe simplest and most common type of eval has an input and an ideal response or answer. For example,\nwe can have an eval sample where the input is \"What year was Obama elected president for the first\ntime?\" and the ideal answer is \"2008\". We feed the input to a model and get the completion. If the model\nsays \"2008\", it is then graded as correct. We can write a string match to check if the completion includes the phrase \"2008\". If it does, we consider it correct.\n\nConsider another eval where the input is to generate valid JSON: We can write some code that\nattempts to parse the completion as JSON and then considers the completion correct if it is\nparsable.\n\n**Model grading: A two stage process where the model first answers the question, then we ask a\nmodel to look at the response to check if it’s correct.**\n\nConsider an input that asks the model to write a funny joke. The model then generates a\ncompletion. We then create a new input to the model to answer the question: \"Is this following\njoke funny? First reason step by step, then answer yes or no\" that includes the completion.\" We\nfinally consider the original completion correct if the new model completion ends with \"yes\".\n\nModel grading works best with the latest, most powerful models like GPT-4 and if we give them the ability\nto reason before making a judgment. Model grading will have an error rate, so it is important to validate\nthe performance with human evaluation before running the evals at scale. For best results, it makes\nsense to use a different model to do grading from the one that did the completion, like using GPT-4 to\ngrade GPT-3.5 answers.\n\nOpenAI Eval Templates\n\nIn using evals, we have discovered several \"templates\" that accommodate many different benchmarks. We have implemented these templates in the OpenAI Evals library to simplify the development of new evals. For example, we have defined 2 types of eval templates that can be used out of the box:\n\nBasic Eval Templates**: These contain deterministic functions to compare the output to the ideal_answers. In cases where the desired model response has very little variation, such as answering multiple choice questions or simple questions with a straightforward answer, we have found this following templates to be useful.\n\nModel-Graded Templates**: These contain functions where an LLM compares the output to the ideal_answers and attempts to judge the accuracy. In cases where the desired model response can contain significant variation, such as answering an open-ended question, we have found that using the model to grade itself is a viable strategy for automated evaluation.\n\nGetting Setup\n\nFirst, go to github.com/openai/evals, clone the repository with git clone git@github.com:openai/evals.git and go through the setup instructions.\n\nTo run evals later in this notebook, you will need to set up and specify your OpenAI API key. After you obtain an API key, specify it using the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\n\nPlease be aware of the costs associated with using the API when running evals.\nBuilding an evaluation for OpenAI Evals framework\n\nAt its core, an eval is a dataset and an eval class that is defined in a YAML file. To start creating an eval, we need\n\nThe test dataset in the jsonl format.\nThe eval template to be used\n\nCreating the eval dataset\nLets create a dataset for a use case where we are evaluating the model's ability to generate syntactically correct SQL. In this use case, we have a series of tables that are related to car manufacturing\n\nFirst we will need to create a system prompt that we would like to evaluate. We will pass in instructions for the model as well as an overview of the table structure:\n\"TASK: Answer the following question with syntactically correct SQLite SQL. The SQL should be correct and be in context of the previous question-answer pairs.\\nTable car_makers, columns = [,Id,Maker,FullName,Country]\\nTable car_names, columns = [,MakeId,Model,Make]\\nTable cars_data, columns = [,Id,MPG,Cylinders,Edispl,Horsepower,Weight,Accelerate,Year]\\nTable continents, columns = [,ContId,Continent]\\nTable countries, columns = [,CountryId,CountryName,Continent]\\nTable model_list, columns = [,ModelId,Maker,Model]\\nForeign_keys = [countries.Continent = continents.ContId,car_makers.Country = countries.CountryId,model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id,car_names.Model = model_list.Model,cars_data.Id = car_names.MakeId]\"\n\nFor this prompt, we can ask a specific question:\n\"Q: how many car makers are their in germany?\"\n\nAnd we have an expected answer:\n\"A: SELECT count ( * )  FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN COUNTRIES AS T2 ON T1.Country   =   T2.CountryId WHERE T2.CountryName   =   'germany'\"\n\nThe dataset needs to be in the following format:\n\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": }, \"ideal\": \"correct answer\"]\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"TASK: Answer the following question with syntactically correct SQLite SQL. The SQL should be correct and be in context of the previous question-answer pairs.\\nTable car_makers, columns = [,Id,Maker,FullName,Country]\\nTable car_names, columns = [,MakeId,Model,Make]\\nTable cars_data, columns = [,Id,MPG,Cylinders,Edispl,Horsepower,Weight,Accelerate,Year]\\nTable continents, columns = [,ContId,Continent]\\nTable countries, columns = [,CountryId,CountryName,Continent]\\nTable model_list, columns = [,ModelId,Maker,Model]\\nForeign_keys = [countries.Continent = continents.ContId,car_makers.Country = countries.CountryId,model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id,car_names.Model = model_list.Model,cars_data.Id = car_names.MakeId]\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Q: how many car makers are their in germany\"}, \"ideal\": [\"A: SELECT count ( * )  FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN COUNTRIES AS T2 ON T1.Country   =   T2.CountryId WHERE T2.CountryName   =   'germany'\"]}\n\n\nOne way to speed up the process of building eval datasets, is to use GPT-4 to generate synthetic data\nOnce we have the synthetic data, we need to convert it to match the format of the eval dataset.\nNext we need to create the eval registry to run it in the framework.\n\nThe evals framework requires a .yaml file structured with the following properties:\nid - An identifier for your eval\ndescription - A short description of your eval\ndisclaimer - An additional notes about your eval\nmetrics - There are three types of eval metrics we can choose from: match, includes, fuzzyMatch\n\nFor our eval, we will configure the following:\nRunning an evaluation\n\nWe can run this eval using the oaieval CLI. To get setup, install the library: pip install . (if you are running the OpenAI Evals library locally) or pip install oaieval if you are running an existing eval.\n\nThen, run the eval using the CLI: oaieval gpt-3.5-turbo spider-sql\n\nThis command expects a model name and an eval set name. Note that we provide two command line interfaces (CLIs): oaieval for running a single eval and oaievalset for running a set of evals. The valid eval names are specified in the YAML files under evals/registry/evals and their corresponding implementations can be found in evals/elsuite.\nThe oaieval CLI can accept various flags to modify the default behavior. You can run oaieval --help to see a full list of CLI options.\n\nAfter running that command, you’ll see the final report of accuracy printed to the console, as well as a file path to a temporary file that contains the full report.\nThese CLIs can accept various flags to modify their default behavior. You can run oaieval --help to see a full list of CLI options.\n\nAfter running that command, you’ll see the final report of accuracy printed to the console, as well as a file path to a temporary file that contains the full report.\noaievalset expects a model name and an eval set name, for which the valid options are specified in the YAML files under evals/registry/eval_sets.\nGoing through eval logs\n\nThe eval logs are located at /tmp/evallogs and different log files are created for each evaluation run.\nThis file will contain structured logs of the evaluation. The first entry provides a detailed specification of the evaluation, including the completion functions, evaluation name, run configuration, creator’s name, run ID, and creation timestamp.\nLet's also look at the entry which provides the final report of the evaluation.\nWe can also review individual evaluation events that provide specific samples (sample_id), results, event types, and metadata.\nLet's review our failures to understand which tests did not succeed.\nReviewing some of the failures we see the following:\nThe second incorrect answer had an unnecessary join with the 'Templates' table. Our eval was able to accurately identify this and flag this as incorrect.\nFew other answers have minor syntax differences that caused the answers to get flagged.\n  In situations like this, it would be worthwhile exploring whether we should continue iterating on the prompt to ensure certain stylistic choices, or if we should modify the evaluation suite to capture this variation.\n  This type of failure hints at the potential need for model-graded evals as a way to ensure accuracy in grading the results\nConclusion\nBuilding out effective evals is a core part of the development cycle of LLM-based applications. The OpenAI Evals framework provides the core structure of building evals out of the box, and allows you to quickly spin up new tests for your various use cases. In this guide, we demonstrated step-by-step how to create an eval, run it, and analyze the results.\n\nThe example shown in this guide represent a straightfoward use case for evals. As you continue to explore this framework, we recommend you explore creating more complex model-graded evals for actual production use cases.

Some of the code below may rely on deprecated API endpoints.\n1. Collect Wikipedia data about Olympic Games 2020\n\nThe idea of this project is to create a question answering model, based on a few paragraphs of provided text. Base GPT-3 models do a good job at answering questions when the answer is contained within the paragraph, however if the answer isn't contained, the base models tend to try their best to answer anyway, often leading to confabulated answers.\n\nTo create a model which answers questions only if there is sufficient context for doing so, we first create a dataset of questions and answers based on paragraphs of text. In order to train the model to answer only when the answer is present, we also add adversarial examples, where the question doesn't match the context. In those cases, we ask the model to output \"No sufficient context for answering the question\".\n\nWe will perform this task in three notebooks:\nThe first (this) notebook focuses on collecting recent data, which GPT-3 didn't see during it's pre-training. We picked the topic of Olympic Games 2020 (which actually took place in the summer of 2021), and downloaded 713 unique pages. We organized the dataset by individual sections, which will serve as context for asking and answering the questions.\nThe second notebook will utilize Davinci-instruct to ask a few questions based on a Wikipedia section, as well as answer those questions, based on that section.\nThe third notebook will utilize the dataset of context, question and answer pairs to additionally create adversarial questions and context pairs, where the question was not generated on that context. In those cases the model will be prompted to answer \"No sufficient context for answering the question\". We will also train a discriminator model, which predicts whether the question can be answered based on the context or not.\n1.1 Data extraction using the wikipedia API\nExtracting the data will take about half an hour, and processing will likely take about as much.\n1.2 Filtering the Wikipedia pages and splitting them into sections by headings\nWe remove sections unlikely to contain textual information, and ensure that each section is not longer than the token limit\n1.2.1 We create a dataset and filter out any sections with fewer than 40 tokens, as those are unlikely to contain enough context to ask a good question.\nSave the section dataset\nWe will save the section dataset, for the next notebook\n1.3 (Optional) Exploring the data\nThere appear to be winter and summer Olympics 2020. We chose to leave a little ambiguity and noise in the dataset, even though we were interested in only Summer Olympics 2020.\nWe can see that the majority of section are fairly short (less than 500 tokens)."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"40:T141d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Note: To answer questions based on text documents, we recommend the procedure in Question Answering using Embeddings. Some of the code below may rely on deprecated API endpoints.\n2. Creating a synthetic Q\u0026A dataset\nWe use davinci-instruct-beta-v3, a model specialized in following instructions, to create questions based on the given context. Then we also use davinci-instruct-beta-v3 to answer those questions, given the same context.\n\nThis is expensive, and will also take a long time, as we call the davinci engine for each section. You can simply download the final dataset instead.\n\nWe're using the dataset created using the previous notebook\n2.1 Read in the data, and create a context\nCreate a context by concatenating the title, the heading and the content of that section\n2.2 Create questions based on the context\nUse davinci-instruct to generate a number of plausible questions relating to the Wikipedia section contents.\n\nNote: We have used temperature=0, but it may be beneficial to experiment with a higher temperature to get a higher diversity of questions.\n\nWARNING: This step will last a long time, and consume a lot of tokens, as it calls davinci-instruct for every section to generate a number of questions.\nThe prompt is designed to generate a number of questions. Example questions above were generated based on the summary section of the 2020 Summer Olympics page.\n\nWe can observe that the questions 3 and 5 above repeat. Sometimes the generated questions could be ambiguous without the context. We will show that even despite these limitations we can create a successful model.\n2.3 Create answers based on the context\nUse davinci-instruct to answer the questions given the relevant Wikipedia section contents\n\nNote: We have used temperature=0, but it may be beneficial to experiment with a higher temperature to get a higher diversity of questions.\n\nWARNING: This step will last a long time, and consume a lot of tokens, as it calls davinci-instruct for every section to answer all the questions.\nThese are the answers to the questions above based on the context around the host city selection.\n\nWe can see that answers 3-5 contain the correct answer, but instead of answering the question directly, the answer is a verbatim extraction. Despite these occasional lower quality answers, we will show that the model can learn the task reasonably well, given a high number of examples.\n2.4 Save the Olympics Q\u0026A dataset based on Wikipedia sections\nWe save the file for use in the next notebook\n2.5 Search file (DEPRECATED)\nWe create a search file (API reference), which can be used to retrieve the relevant context when a question is asked.\n\nDEPRECATED: The /search endpoint is deprecated in favour of using embeddings. Embeddings are cheaper, faster and can support a better search experience. See Question Answering Guide for a search implementation using the embeddings\n\n2.6 Answer questions based on the context provided\n\nWe will use a simple implementation of the answers endpoint. This works by simply using the /search endpoint, which searches over an indexed file to obtain the relevant sections which can be included in the context, following by a question and answering prompt given a specified model.\nAfter we fine-tune the model for Q\u0026A we'll be able to use it instead of davinci-instruct-beta-v3, to obtain better answers when the question can't be answered based on the context. We see a downside of davinci-instruct-beta-v3, which always attempts to answer the question, regardless of the relevant context being present or not. (Note the second question is asking about a future event, set in 2024.)\nWe can see that davinci has a tendency to answer the question, even if the question can't be answered given the context provided. Note the question asked regarding 2048 Summer Olympics, which didn't happen yet, and the retrieved content has only returned results for 2020.\n2.7 (Optional) Investigation into how likely the search endpoint is to return the relevant context\nWe utilize the generated questions based on context to estimate how often we can retrieve the original context. These questions are noisy, so this is not a perfect estimate.\n\nOur questions and answers are prefixed with numbered bullet points, however due to the way they were generated, they are missing the first number, hence we add \"1.\" to the list of questions (and answers).\n\nWe calculate the rank of the section retrieved using ada search, and the number of tokens in the context needed to retrieve the relevant section in full.\nThe relevant context can be obtained 74% of the time on this dataset\n7.4% of the time, this is due to the keyword search part of the search algorithm not retrieving the relevant context within the first 200 results.\n18.3% of the time this is due to the semantic search not placing the relevant context within the first 2000 tokens.\nWe can observe that the context is most likely to be returned as one of the first results, and most likely to be returned within the first 200-500 tokens.\nprobabilities of the relevant context being returned at each rank.

Train a fine-tuning model specialized for Q\u0026A\nThis notebook will utilize the dataset of context, question and answer pairs to additionally create adversarial questions and context pairs, where the question was not generated on that context. In those cases the model will be prompted to answer \"No sufficient context for answering the question\". We will also train a discriminator model, which predicts whether the question can be answered based on the context or not.\n\nWe will add hard adversarial examples as well, which will be based either on semantically similar sections, or neighbouring sections, originating from the same article.\nSplit the sections into a training and testing set\nwe check that the separator we intend to use isn't present within the contexts\n3.1 Create the fine-tuning datasets for Q\u0026A and discriminator models\nThe fine-tuning dataset is created in the following way. For every corresponding question, answer and context pair we create:\nPositive example: correct question, answer, context pair\nNegative examples:\n  random negative example, where the random context is paired with the question\n  two hard negative examples\n    one originating from the same wikipedia article\n    another, which is most similar to the correct context\n\nThis process is noisy, as sometimes the question might be answerable given a different context, but on average we hope this won't affect the performance too much.\n\nWe apply the same process of dataset creation for both the discriminator, and the Q\u0026A answering model. We apply the process separately for the training and testing set, to ensure that the examples from the training set don't feature within the test set.\nWe apply the same process of dataset creation for both the discriminator, and the Q\u0026A answering model. We apply the process separately for the training and testing set, to ensure that the examples from the training set don't feature within the test set.\nWe formatted the data according to the recommendations from the fine-tuning tool, which is available using\nopenai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f qa_train.jsonl\n\nWe highly recommend that you use this tool, which suggests improvements in your data formatting for fine-tuning.\n\n3.2 Submit the datasets for fine-tuning\n3.3 Using the fine-tuned models\n\nWe will now use the fine-tuned discriminator and the fine-tuned Q\u0026A model. By requesting logprobs, we can see how certain the discriminator is in a yes vs no answer.\nWe can see that the model can generalize well to different contexts and questions.\nWe can see that the model can answer the question, when the context is appropriate.\nWe can see that the model knows when to answer the question, and when to say that insufficient context is present to answer the question.\nWe can also combine a discriminator and a base model, or a fine-tuned Q\u0026A model. Discriminator can essentially serve as a decision whether the question can be answered given the context or not.\nThe above function illustrates how to potentially combine a discriminator and a fine-tuned Q\u0026A model. This gives a more fine-grained control over how certain we want the model to be before it answers the question.\n\nWe'll now take a look on how answers endpoint works - combining search to retrieve the relevant context from a knowledge base, and then using the fine-tuned Q\u0026A model to answer the question.\n3.4 Answering the question based on a knowledge base\nFinally we can use a logic similar to the /answers endpoint, where we first search for the relevant context, and then ask a Q\u0026A model to answer the question given that context.

Fully compatible with PostgreSQL syntax, you can effortlessly utilize it. AnalyticDB is Alibaba Cloud managed cloud-native database with strong-performed vector compute engine. Absolute out-of-box experience allow to scale into billions of data vectors processing with rich features including indexing algorithms, structured \u0026 non-structured data features, realtime update, distance metrics, scalar filtering, time travel searches etc. Also equipped with full OLAP database functionality and SLA commitment for production usage promise;\n\nDeployment options\n\nUsing AnalyticDB Cloud Vector Database. Click here to fast deploy it.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nFor the purposes of this exercise we need to prepare a couple of things:\n\nAnalyticDB cloud server instance.\nThe 'psycopg2' library to interact with the vector database. Any other postgresql client library is ok.\nAn OpenAI API key.\n\n\nWe might validate if the server was launched successfully by running a simple curl command:\n\nInstall requirements\n\nThis notebook obviously requires the openai and psycopg2 packages, but there are also some other additional libraries we will use. The following command installs them all:\n\nPrepare your OpenAI API key\n\nThe OpenAI API key is used for vectorization of the documents and queries.\n\nIf you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.\n\nOnce you get your key, please add it to your environment variables as OPENAI_API_KEY.\nConnect to AnalyticDB\nFirst add it to your environment variables. or you can just change the \"psycopg2.connect\" parameters below\n\nConnecting to a running instance of AnalyticDB server is easy with the official Python library:\nWe can test the connection by running any available method:\nThe downloaded file has to be then extracted:\nIndex data\n\nAnalyticDB stores data in relation where each object is described by at least one vector. Our relation will be called articles and each object will be described by both title and content vectors. \\\n\nWe will start with creating a relation and create a vector index on both title and content, and then we will fill it with our precomputed embeddings.\nLoad data\n\nIn this section we are going to load the data prepared previous to this session, so you don't have to recompute the embeddings of Wikipedia articles with your own credits.\nSearch data\n\nOnce the data is put into Qdrant we will start querying the collection for the closest vectors.

You need to export them first to set correct connect string. Then build the connection string.\nLoad data\nIn this section we are going to load the data containing some natural questions and answers to them. All the data will be used to create a Langchain application with AnalyticDB being the knowledge base.\nChain definition\n\nLangchain is already integrated with AnalyticDB and performs all the indexing for given list of documents. In our case we are going to store the set of answers we have.\nAt this stage all the possible answers are already stored in  AnalyticDB, so we can define the whole QA chain.\nSearch data\n\nOnce the data is put into AnalyticDB we can start asking some questions. A question will be automatically vectorized by OpenAI model, and the created vector will be used to find some possibly matching answers in AnalyticDB. Once retrieved, the most similar answers will be incorporated into the prompt sent to OpenAI Large Language Model.\n\nCustom prompt templates\n\nThe stuff chain type in Langchain uses a specific prompt with question and context documents incorporated.

You will evaluate and store the vector embeddings for a number of quotes by famous philosophers, use them to build a powerful search engine and, after that, even a generator of new quotes!\n\nThe notebook exemplifies some of the standard usage patterns of vector search -- while showing how easy is it to get started with the vector capabilities of Cassandra / Astra DB through CQL.\n\nFor a background on using vector search and text embeddings to build a question-answering system, please check out this excellent hands-on notebook: Question answering using embeddings.\n\nChoose-your-framework\n\nPlease note that this notebook uses the Cassandra drivers and runs CQL (Cassandra Query Language) statements directly, but we cover other choices of technology to accomplish the same task.

This notebook can run either as a Colab notebook or as a regular Jupyter notebook.\n\nTable of contents:\nSetup\nGet DB connection\nConnect to OpenAI\nLoad quotes into the Vector Store\nUse case 1: quote search engine\nUse case 2: quote generator\n(Optional) exploit partitioning in the Vector Store\nHow it works\n\nIndexing\n\nEach quote is made into an embedding vector with OpenAI's Embedding. These are saved in the Vector Store for later use in searching. Some metadata, including the author's name and a few other pre-computed tags, are stored alongside, to allow for search customization.\n\n1_vector_indexing_cql\n\nSearch\n\nTo find a quote similar to the provided search quote, the latter is made into an embedding vector on the fly, and this vector is used to query the store for similar vectors ... i.e. similar quotes that were previously indexed. The search can optionally be constrained by additional metadata (\"find me quotes by Spinoza similar to this one ...\").\n\n2_vector_search_cql\n\nThe key point here is that \"quotes similar in content\" translates, in vector space, to vectors that are metrically close to each other: thus, vector similarity search effectively implements semantic similarity. This is the key reason vector embeddings are so powerful.\n\nThe sketch below tries to convey this idea. Each quote, once it's made into a vector, is a point in space. Well, in this case it's on a sphere, since OpenAI's embedding vectors, as most others, are normalized to unit length. Oh, and the sphere is actually not three-dimensional, rather 1536-dimensional!\n\nSo, in essence, a similarity search in vector space returns the vectors that are closest to the query vector:\n\n3_vector_space\n\nGeneration\n\nGiven a suggestion (a topic or a tentative quote), the search step is performed, and the first returned results (quotes) are fed into an LLM prompt which asks the generative model to invent a new text along the lines of the passed examples and the initial suggestion.\n\n4_quote_generation\nSetup\nInstall and import the necessary dependencies:\nDon't mind the next cell too much, we need it to detect Colabs and let you upload the SCB file (see below):\nGet DB connection\nA couple of secrets are required to create a Session object (a connection to your Astra DB instance).\n\n(Note: some steps will be slightly different on Google Colab and on local Jupyter, that's why the notebook will detect the runtime type.)\nCreation of the DB connection\n\nThis is how you create a connection to Astra DB:\n\n(Incidentally, you could also use any Cassandra cluster (as long as it provides Vector capabilities), just by changing the parameters to the following Cluster instantiation.)\nCreation of the Vector table in CQL\n\nYou need a table which support vectors and is equipped with metadata. Call it \"philosophers_cql\".\n\nEach row will store: a quote, its vector embedding, the quote author and a set of \"tags\". You also need a primary key to ensure uniqueness of rows.\n\nThe following is the full CQL command that creates the table (check out this page for more on the CQL syntax of this and the following statements):\nPass this statement to your database Session to execute it:\nAdd a vector index for ANN search\nIn order to run ANN (approximate-nearest-neighbor) searches on the vectors in the table, you need to create a specific index on the embedding_vector column.\n\nWhen creating the index, you can optionally choose the \"similarity function\" used to compute vector distances: since for unit-length vectors (such as those from OpenAI) the \"cosine difference\" is the same as the \"dot product\", you'll use the latter which is computationally less expensive.\n\nRun this CQL statement:\nAdd indexes for author and tag filtering\nThat is enough to run vector searches on the table ... but you want to be able to optionally specify an author and/or some tags to restrict the quote search. Create two other indexes to support this:\nConnect to OpenAI\nSet up your secret key\nA test call for embeddings\n\nQuickly check how one can get the embedding vectors for a list of input texts:\nNote: the above is the syntax for OpenAI v1.0+. If using previous versions, the code to get the embeddings will look different.\nLoad quotes into the Vector Store\nGet a dataset with the quotes. (We adapted and augmented the data from this Kaggle dataset, ready to use in this demo.)\nA quick inspection:\nCheck the dataset size:\nInsert quotes into vector store\n\nYou will compute the embeddings for the quotes and save them into the Vector Store, along with the text itself and the metadata planned for later use.\n\nTo optimize speed and reduce the calls, you'll perform batched calls to the embedding OpenAI service.\n\nThe DB write is accomplished with a CQL statement. But since you'll run this particular insertion several times (albeit with different values), it's best to prepare the statement and then just run it over and over.\n\n(Note: for faster insertion, the Cassandra drivers would let you do concurrent inserts, which we don't do here for a more straightforward demo code.)\nUse case 1: quote search engine\nFor the quote-search functionality, you need first to make the input quote into a vector, and then use it to query the store (besides handling the optional metadata into the search call, that is).\n\nEncapsulate the search-engine functionality into a function for ease of re-use:\nPutting search to test\nPassing just a quote:\nSearch restricted to an author:\nSearch constrained to a tag (out of those saved earlier with the quotes):\nCutting out irrelevant results\n\nThe vector similarity search generally returns the vectors that are closest to the query, even if that means results that might be somewhat irrelevant if there's nothing better.\n\nTo keep this issue under control, you can get the actual \"similarity\" between the query and each result, and then set a cutoff on it, effectively discarding results that are beyond that threshold.\nTuning this threshold correctly is not an easy problem: here, we'll just show you the way.\n\nTo get a feeling on how this works, try the following query and play with the choice of quote and threshold to compare the results:\n\nNote (for the mathematically inclined): this value is a rescaling between zero and one of the cosine difference between the vectors, i.e. of the scalar product divided by the product of the norms of the two vectors. In other words, this is 0 for opposite-facing vecors and +1 for parallel vectors. For other measures of similarity, check the documentation -- and keep in mind that the metric in the SELECT query should match the one used when creating the index earlier for meaningful, ordered results.\nUse case 2: quote generator\nFor this task you need another component from OpenAI, namely an LLM to generate the quote for us (based on input obtained by querying the Vector Store).\n\nYou also need a template for the prompt that will be filled for the generate-quote LLM completion task.\nLike for search, this functionality is best wrapped into a handy function (which internally uses search):\nNote: similar to the case of the embedding computation, the code for the Chat Completion API would be slightly different for OpenAI prior to v1.0.\nPutting quote generation to test\nJust passing a text (a \"quote\", but one can actually just suggest a topic since its vector embedding will still end up at the right place in the vector space):\nUse inspiration from just a single philosopher:\n(Optional) Partitioning\nThere's an interesting topic to examine before completing this quickstart. While, generally, tags and quotes can be in any relationship (e.g. a quote having multiple tags), authors are effectively an exact grouping (they define a \"disjoint partitioning\" on the set of quotes): each quote has exactly one author (for us, at least).\n\nNow, suppose you know in advance your application will usually (or always) run queries on a single author. Then you can take full advantage of the underlying database structure: if you group quotes in partitions (one per author), vector queries on just an author will use less resources and return much faster.\n\nWe'll not dive into the details here, which have to do with the Cassandra storage internals: the important message is that if your queries are run within a group, consider partitioning accordingly to boost performance.\n\nYou'll now see this choice in action.\nThe partitioning per author calls for a new table schema: create a new table called \"philosophers_cql_partitioned\", along with the necessary indexes:\nNow repeat the compute-embeddings-and-insert step on the new table.\n\nYou could use the very same insertion code as you did earlier, because the differences are hidden \"behind the scenes\": the database will store the inserted rows differently according to the partioning scheme of this new table.\n\nHowever, by way of demonstration, you will take advantage of a handy facility offered by the Cassandra drivers to easily run several queries (in this case, INSERTs) concurrently. This is something that Cassandra / Astra DB through CQL supports very well and can lead to a significant speedup, with very little changes in the client code.\n\n(Note: one could additionally have cached the embeddings computed previously to save a few API tokens -- here, however, we wanted to keep the code easier to inspect.)\nDespite the different table schema, the DB query behind the similarity search is essentially the same:\nThat's it: the new table still supports the \"generic\" similarity searches all right ...\n... but it's when an author is specified that you would notice a huge performance advantage:\nWell, you would notice a performance gain, if you had a realistic-size dataset. In this demo, with a few tens of entries, there's no noticeable difference -- but you get the idea.\nConclusion\n\nCongratulations! You have learned how to use OpenAI for vector embeddings and Astra DB / Cassandra for storage in order to build a sophisticated philosophical search engine and quote generator.\n\nThis example used the Cassandra drivers and runs CQL (Cassandra Query Language) statements directly to interface with the Vector Store - but this is not the only choice.

This is a common requirement for customers who want to store and search our embeddings with their own data in a secure environment to support production use cases such as chatbots, topic modelling and more.\n\nWhat is a Vector Database\n\nA vector database is a database made to store, manage and search embedding vectors. The use of embeddings to encode unstructured data (text, audio, video and more) as vectors for consumption by machine-learning models has exploded in recent years, due to the increasing effectiveness of AI in solving use cases involving natural language, image recognition and other unstructured forms of data. Vector databases have emerged as an effective solution for enterprises to deliver and scale these use cases.\n\nWhy use a Vector Database\n\nVector databases enable enterprises to take many of the embeddings use cases we've shared in this repo (question and answering, chatbot and recommendation services, for example), and make use of them in a secure, scalable environment. Many of our customers make embeddings solve their problems at small scale but performance and security hold them back from going into production - we see vector databases as a key component in solving that, and in this guide we'll walk through the basics of embedding text data, storing it in a vector database and using it for semantic search.\n\nDemo Flow\nThe demo flow is:\nSetup**: Import packages and set any required variables\nLoad data**: Load a dataset and embed it using OpenAI embeddings\nChroma**:\n    Setup: Here we'll set up the Python client for Chroma. For more details go here\n    Index Data: We'll create collections with vectors for titles and content\n    Search Data: We'll run a few searches to confirm it works\n\nOnce you've run through this notebook you should have a basic understanding of how to setup and use vector databases, and can move on to more complex use cases making use of our embeddings.\nSetup\n\nImport the required libraries and set the embedding model that we'd like to use.\nLoad data\n\nIn this section we'll load embedded data that we've prepared previous to this session.\nChroma\n\nWe'll index these embedded documents in a vector database and search them. The first option we'll look at is Chroma, an easy to use open-source self-hosted in-memory vector database, designed for working with embeddings together with LLMs.\n\nIn this section, we will:\nInstantiate the Chroma client\nCreate collections for each class of embedding\nQuery each collection\nInstantiate the Chroma client\n\nCreate the Chroma client. By default, Chroma is ephemeral and runs in memory.\nHowever, you can easily set up a persistent configuration which writes to disk.\nCreate collections\n\nChroma collections allow you to store and filter with arbitrary metadata, making it easy to query subsets of the embedded data.\n\nChroma is already integrated with OpenAI's embedding functions. The best way to use them is on construction of a collection, as follows.\nAlternatively, you can 'bring your own embeddings'. More information can be found here\nPopulate the collections\n\nChroma collections allow you to populate, and filter on, whatever metadata you like. Chroma can also store the text alongside the vectors, and return everything in a single query call, when this is more convenient.\n\nFor this use-case, we'll just store the embeddings and IDs, and use these to index the original dataframe.\nSearch the collections\n\nChroma handles embedding queries for you if an embedding function is set, like in this example.\nNow that you've got a basic embeddings search running, you can hop over to the Chroma docs to learn more about how to add filters to your query, update/delete data in your collections, and deploy Chroma."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4d:T2319,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis notebook guides you step-by-step through answering questions about a collection of data, using Chroma, an open-source embeddings database, along with OpenAI's text embeddings and chat completion API's.\n\nAdditionally, this notebook demonstrates some of the tradeoffs in making a question answering system more robust. As we shall see, simple querying doesn't always create the best results!\n\nQuestion Answering with LLMs\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT can be used to answer questions about data that the model may not have been trained on, or have access to. For example;\n\nPersonal data like e-mails and notes\nHighly specialized data like archival or legal documents\nNewly created data like recent news stories\n\nIn order to overcome this limitation, we can use a data store which is amenable to querying in natural language, just like the LLM itself. An embeddings store like Chroma represents documents as embeddings, alongside the documents themselves.\n\nBy embedding a text query, Chroma can find relevant documents, which we can then pass to the LLM to answer our question. We'll show detailed examples and variants of this approach.\nSetup and preliminaries\n\nFirst we make sure the python dependencies we need are installed.\nWe use OpenAI's API's throughout this notebook. You can get an API key from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys\n\nYou can add your API key as an environment variable by executing the command export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx in a terminal. Note that you will need to reload the notebook if the environment variable wasn't set yet. Alternatively, you can set it in the notebook, see below.\nDataset\n\nThroughout this notebook, we use the SciFact dataset. This is a curated dataset of expert annotated scientific claims, with an accompanying text corpus of paper titles and abstracts. Each claim may be supported, contradicted, or not have enough evidence either way, according to the documents in the corpus.\n\nHaving the corpus available as ground-truth allows us to investigate how well the following approaches to LLM question answering perform.\nJust asking the model\n\nGPT-3.5 was trained on a large amount of scientific information. As a baseline, we'd like to understand what the model already knows without any further context. This will allow us to calibrate overall performance.\n\nWe construct an appropriate prompt, with some example facts, then query the model with each claim in the dataset. We ask the model to assess a claim as 'True', 'False', or 'NEE' if there is not enough evidence one way or the other.\nWe sample 100 claims from the dataset\nWe evaluate the ground-truth according to the dataset. From the dataset description, each claim is either supported or contradicted by the evidence, or else there isn't enough evidence either way.\nWe also output the confusion matrix, comparing the model's assessments with the ground truth, in an easy to read table.\nWe ask the model to directly assess the claims, without additional context.\nResults\n\nFrom these results we see that the LLM is strongly biased to assess claims as true, even when they are false, and also tends to assess false claims as not having enough evidence. Note that 'not enough evidence' is with respect to the model's assessment of the claim in a vacuum, without additional context.\n\nAdding context\n\nWe now add the additional context available from the corpus of paper titles and abstracts. This section shows how to load a text corpus into Chroma, using OpenAI text embeddings.\nFirst, we load the text corpus.\nLoading the corpus into Chroma\n\nThe next step is to load the corpus into Chroma. Given an embedding function, Chroma will automatically handle embedding each document, and will store it alongside its text and metadata, making it simple to query.\nWe instantiate a (ephemeral) Chroma client, and create a collection for the SciFact title and abstract corpus.\nChroma can also be instantiated in a persisted configuration; learn more at the Chroma docs.\nNext we load the corpus into Chroma. Because this data loading is memory intensive, we recommend using a batched loading scheme in batches of 50-1000. For this example it should take just over one minute for the entire corpus. It's being embedded in the background, automatically, using the embedding_function we specified earlier.\nRetrieving context\n\nNext we retrieve documents from the corpus which may be relevant to each claim in our sample. We want to provide these as context to the LLM for evaluating the claims. We retrieve the 3 most relevant documents for each claim, according to the embedding distance.\nWe create a new prompt, this time taking into account the additional context we retrieve from the corpus.\nThen ask the model to evaluate the claims with the retrieved context.\nResults\n\nWe see that the model is a lot less likely to evaluate a False claim as true (2 instances VS 5 previously), but that claims without enough evidence are still often assessed as True or False.\n\nTaking a look at the retrieved documents, we see that they are sometimes not relevant to the claim - this causes the model to be confused by the extra information, and it may decide that sufficient evidence is present, even when the information is irrelevant. This happens because we always ask for the 3 'most' relevant documents, but these might not be relevant at all beyond a certain point.\nFiltering context on relevance\n\nAlong with the documents themselves, Chroma returns a distance score. We can try thresholding on distance, so that fewer irrelevant documents make it into the context we provide the model.\n\nIf, after filtering on the threshold, no context documents remain, we bypass the model and simply return that there is not enough evidence.\nNow we assess the claims using this cleaner context.\nResults\n\nThe model now assesses many fewer claims as True or False when there is not enough evidence present. However, it now biases away from certainty. Most claims are now assessed as having not enough evidence, because a large fraction of them are filtered out by the distance threshold. It's possible to tune the distance threshold to find the optimal operating point, but this can be difficult, and is dataset and embedding model dependent.\nHypothetical Document Embeddings: Using hallucinations productively\n\nWe want to be able to retrieve relevant documents, without retrieving less relevant ones which might confuse the model. One way to accomplish this is to improve the retrieval query.\n\nUntil now, we have queried the dataset using claims which are single sentence statements, while the corpus contains abstracts describing a scientific paper. Intuitively, while these might be related, there are significant differences in their structure and meaning. These differences are encoded by the embedding model, and so influence the distances between the query and the most relevant results.\n\nWe can overcome this by leveraging the power of LLMs to generate relevant text. While the facts might be hallucinated, the content and structure of the documents the models generate is more similar to the documents in our corpus, than the queries are. This could lead to better queries and hence better results.\n\nThis approach is called Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE), and has been shown to be quite good at the retrieval task. It should help us bring more relevant information into the context, without polluting it.\n\nTL;DR:\nyou get much better matches when you embed whole abstracts rather than single sentences\nbut claims are usually single sentences\nSo HyDE shows that using GPT3 to expand claims into hallucinated abstracts and then searching based on those abstracts works (claims -\u003e abstracts -\u003e results) better than searching directly (claims -\u003e results)\nFirst, we use in-context examples to prompt the model to generate documents similar to what's in the corpus, for each claim we want to assess.\nWe hallucinate a document for each claim.\n\nNB: This can take a while, about 30m for 100 claims. You can reduce the number of claims we want to assess to get results more quickly.\nWe use the hallucinated documents as queries into the corpus, and filter the results using the same distance threshold.\nWe then ask the model to assess the claims, using the new context.\nResults\n\nCombining HyDE with a simple distance threshold leads to a significant improvement. The model no longer biases assessing claims as True, nor toward their not being enough evidence. It also correctly assesses when there isn't enough evidence more often.\nConclusion\n\nEquipping LLMs with a context based on a corpus of documents is a powerful technique for bringing the general reasoning and natural language interactions of LLMs to your own data. However, it's important to know that naive query and retrieval may not produce the best possible results! Ultimately understanding the data will help get the most out of the retrieval based question-answering approach."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4e:T123f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Open In Colab\n\nThis notebook demonstrates how to:\nIndex the OpenAI Wikipedia vector dataset into Elasticsearch\nEmbed a question with the OpenAI embeddings endpoint\nPerform semantic search on the Elasticsearch index using the encoded question\nSend the top search results to the OpenAI Chat Completions API endpoint for retrieval augmented generation (RAG)\n\nℹ️ If you've already worked through our semantic search notebook, you can skip ahead to the final step!\nInstall packages and import modules\nConnect to Elasticsearch\n\nℹ️ We're using an Elastic Cloud deployment of Elasticsearch for this notebook.\nIf you don't already have an Elastic deployment, you can sign up for a free Elastic Cloud trial.\n\nTo connect to Elasticsearch, you need to create a client instance with the Cloud ID and password for your deployment.\n\nFind the Cloud ID for your deployment by going to https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments and selecting your deployment.\nDownload the dataset\n\nIn this step we download the OpenAI Wikipedia embeddings dataset, and extract the zip file.\nRead CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.\n\nNext we use the Pandas library to read the unzipped CSV file into a DataFrame.

This command launches a Milvus standalone instance which we will use for this test.\nWith Milvus running we can setup our global variables:\nHOST: The Milvus host address\nPORT: The Milvus port number\nCOLLECTION_NAME: What to name the collection within Milvus\nDIMENSION: The dimension of the embeddings\nOPENAI_ENGINE: Which embedding model to use\nopenai.api_key: Your OpenAI account key\nINDEX_PARAM: The index settings to use for the collection\nQUERY_PARAM: The search parameters to use\nBATCH_SIZE: How many texts to embed and insert at once\nMilvus\nThis segment deals with Milvus and setting up the database for this use case. Within Milvus we need to setup a collection and index the collection.\nDataset\nWith Milvus up and running we can begin grabbing our data. Hugging Face Datasets is a hub that holds many different user datasets, and for this example we are using Skelebor's book dataset. This dataset contains title-description pairs for over 1 million books. We are going to embed each description and store it within Milvus along with its title.\nInsert the Data\nNow that we have our data on our machine we can begin embedding it and inserting it into Milvus. The embedding function takes in text and returns the embeddings in a list format.\nThis next step does the actual inserting. Due to having so many datapoints, if you want to immidiately test it out you can stop the inserting cell block early and move along. Doing this will probably decrease the accuracy of the results due to less datapoints, but it should still be good enough.\nQuery the Database\nWith our data safely inserted in Milvus, we can now perform a query. The query takes in a string or a list of strings and searches them. The resuts print out your provided description and the results that include the result score, the result title, and the result book description."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"55:Ta1c,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis notebook provides a step-by-step guide on using MyScale as a vector database for OpenAI embeddings.

It also exclusively uses the ChatCompletion endpoint, so we must use it in a slightly different way to usual. However, the power of the model makes the change worthwhile, particularly when augmented with an external knowledge base like the Pinecone vector database.\n\nRequired installs for this notebook are:\nPreparing the Data\nIn this example, we will download the LangChain docs from langchain.readthedocs.io/. We get all .html files located on the site like so:\nThis downloads all HTML into the rtdocs directory. Now we can use LangChain itself to process these docs. We do this using the ReadTheDocsLoader like so:\nThis leaves us with hundreds of processed doc pages. Let's take a look at the format each one contains:\nWe access the plaintext page content like so:\nWe can also find the source of each document:\nWe can use these to create our data list:\nIt's pretty ugly but it's good enough for now. Let's see how we can process all of these. We will chunk everything into ~400 token chunks, we can do this easily with langchain and tiktoken:\nProcess the data into more chunks using this approach.\nOur chunks are ready so now we move onto embedding and indexing everything.\nInitialize Embedding Model\n\nWe use text-embedding-3-small as the embedding model. We can embed text like so:\nIn the response res we will find a JSON-like object containing our new embeddings within the 'data' field.\nInside 'data' we will find two records, one for each of the two sentences we just embedded. Each vector embedding contains 1536 dimensions (the output dimensionality of the text-embedding-3-small model.\nWe will apply this same embedding logic to the langchain docs dataset we've just scraped. But before doing so we must create a place to store the embeddings.\nInitializing the Index\nNow we need a place to store these embeddings and enable a efficient vector search through them all. To do that we use Pinecone, we can get a free API key and enter it below where we will initialize our connection to Pinecone and create a new index.\nWe can see the index is currently empty with a total_vector_count of 0. We can begin populating it with OpenAI text-embedding-3-small built embeddings like so:\nNow we've added all of our langchain docs to the index. With that we can move on to retrieval and then answer generation using GPT-4.\nRetrieval\nTo search through our documents we first need to create a query vector xq. Using xq we will retrieve the most relevant chunks from the LangChain docs, like so:\nWith retrieval complete, we move on to feeding these into GPT-4 to produce answers.\nRetrieval Augmented Generation\nGPT-4 is currently accessed via the ChatCompletions endpoint of OpenAI. To add the information we retrieved into the model, we need to pass it into our user prompts alongside our original query. We can do that like so:\nNow we ask the question:\nTo display this response nicely, we will display it in markdown.\nLet's compare this to a non-augmented query...\nIf we drop the \"I don't know\" part of the primer?"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"58:T125b,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nFixing LLMs that Hallucinate\n\nIn this notebook we will learn how to query relevant contexts to our queries from Pinecone, and pass these to a generative OpenAI model to generate an answer backed by real data sources.\n\nA common problem with using GPT-3 to factually answer questions is that GPT-3 can sometimes make things up. The GPT models have a broad range of general knowledge, but this does not necessarily apply to more specific information. For that we use the Pinecone vector database as our \"external knowledge base\" — like long-term memory for GPT-3.\n\nRequired installs for this notebook are:\nFor many questions state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs are more than capable of answering correctly.\nHowever, that isn't always the case. First let's first rewrite the above into a simple function so we're not rewriting this every time.\nNow let's ask a more specific question about training a type of transformer model called a sentence transformer. The ideal answer we'd be looking for is \"Multiple Negatives Ranking (MNR) loss\".\n\nDon't worry if this is a new term to you, it isn't required to understand what we're doing or demoing here.\nOne of the common answers we get to this is:\n\nThe best training method to use for fine-tuning a pre-trained model with sentence transformers is the Masked Language Model (MLM) training. MLM training involves randomly masking some of the words in a sentence and then training the model to predict the masked words. This helps the model to learn the context of the sentence and better understand the relationships between words.\n\nThis answer seems pretty convincing right? Yet, it's wrong. MLM is typically used in the pretraining step of a transformer model but \"cannot\" be used to fine-tune a sentence-transformer, and has nothing to do with having \"pairs of related sentences\".\n\nAn alternative answer we receive (and the one we returned above) is about supervised learning approach being the most suitable. This is completely true, but it's not specific and doesn't answer the question.\n\nWe have two options for enabling our LLM in understanding and correctly answering this question:\n\nWe fine-tune the LLM on text data covering the topic mentioned, likely on articles and papers talking about sentence transformers, semantic search training methods, etc.\n\nWe use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that implements an information retrieval component to the generation process. Allowing us to retrieve relevant information and feed this information into the generation model as a secondary source of information.\n\nWe will demonstrate option 2.\nBuilding a Knowledge Base\n\nWith option 2 the retrieval of relevant information requires an external \"Knowledge Base\", a place where we can store and use to efficiently retrieve information. We can think of this as the external long-term memory of our LLM.\n\nWe will need to retrieve information that is semantically related to our queries, to do this we need to use \"dense vector embeddings\". These can be thought of as numerical representations of the meaning behind our sentences.\n\nTo create these dense vectors we use the text-embedding-3-small model.\n\nWe have already authenticated our OpenAI connection, to create an embedding we just do:\nIn the response res we will find a JSON-like object containing our new embeddings within the 'data' field.\nInside 'data' we will find two records, one for each of the two sentences we just embedded. Each vector embedding contains 1536 dimensions (the output dimensionality of the text-embedding-3-small model.\nWe will apply this same embedding logic to a dataset containing information relevant to our query (and many other queries on the topics of ML and AI).\n\nData Preparation\n\nThe dataset we will be using is the jamescalam/youtube-transcriptions from Hugging Face Datasets. It contains transcribed audio from several ML and tech YouTube channels. We download it with:\nThe dataset contains many small snippets of text data. We will need to merge many snippets from each video to create more substantial chunks of text that contain more information.\nNow we need a place to store these embeddings and enable a efficient vector search through them all. To do that we use Pinecone, we can get a free API key and enter it below where we will initialize our connection to Pinecone and create a new index.\nWe can see the index is currently empty with a total_vector_count of 0. We can begin populating it with OpenAI text-embedding-3-small built embeddings like so:\nNow we search, for this we need to create a query vector xq:\nAnd we get a pretty great answer straight away, specifying to use multiple-rankings loss (also called multiple negatives ranking loss)."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"59:T580,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nVector search is an innovative technology that enables developers and engineers to efficiently store, search, and recommend information by representing complex data as mathematical vectors.

It offers both on-premise and cloud version, but for the purposes of that example we're going to use the local deployment mode.\n\nSetting everything up will require:\nSpinning up a local instance of Qdrant\nConfiguring the collection and storing the data in it\nTrying out with some queries\nSetup\n\nFor the local deployment, we are going to use Docker, according to the Qdrant documentation: https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick_start/. Qdrant requires just a single container, but an example of the docker-compose.yaml file is available at ./qdrant/docker-compose.yaml in this repo.\n\nYou can start Qdrant instance locally by navigating to this directory and running docker-compose up -d \nYou might need to increase the memory limit for Docker to 8GB or more. Or Qdrant might fail to execute with an error message like 7 Killed.\n\nIndex data\n\nQdrant stores data in collections where each object is described by at least one vector and may contain an additional metadata called payload. Our collection will be called Articles and each object will be described by both title and content vectors.\n\nWe'll be using an official qdrant-client package that has all the utility methods already built-in.\nIn addition to the vector configuration defined under vector, we can also define the payload configuration. Payload is an optional field that allows you to store additional metadata alongside the vectors. In our case, we'll store the id, title, and url of the articles. As we return the title of nearest articles in the search results from payload, we can also provide the user with the URL to the article (which is part of the meta-data).\nSearch Data\n\nOnce the data is put into Qdrant we will start querying the collection for the closest vectors. We may provide an additional parameter vector_name to switch from title to content based search."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"5f:T1ace,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nRedis\n\nWhat is Redis?\n\nMost developers from a web services background are probably familiar with Redis. At it's core, Redis is an open-source key-value store that can be used as a cache, message broker, and database. Developers choice Redis because it is fast, has a large ecosystem of client libraries, and has been deployed by major enterprises for years.\n\nIn addition to the traditional uses of Redis. Redis also provides Redis Modules which are a way to extend Redis with new capabilities, commands and data types. Example modules include RedisJSON, RedisTimeSeries, RedisBloom and RediSearch.\n\nDeployment options\n\nThere are a number of ways to deploy Redis. For local development, the quickest method is to use the Redis Stack docker container which we will use here. Redis Stack contains a number of Redis modules that can be used together to create a fast, multi-model data store and query engine.\n\nFor production use cases, The easiest way to get started is to use the Redis Cloud service. Redis Cloud is a fully managed Redis service. You can also deploy Redis on your own infrastructure using Redis Enterprise. Redis Enterprise is a fully managed Redis service that can be deployed in kubernetes, on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nAdditionally, every major cloud provider (AWS Marketplace, Google Marketplace, or Azure Marketplace) offers Redis Enterprise in a marketplace offering.\n\nWhat is RediSearch?\n\nRediSearch is a Redis module that provides querying, secondary indexing, full-text search and vector search for Redis. To use RediSearch, you first declare indexes on your Redis data. You can then use the RediSearch clients to query that data. For more information on the feature set of RediSearch, see the RediSearch documentation.\n\nFeatures\n\nRediSearch uses compressed, inverted indexes for fast indexing with a low memory footprint. RediSearch indexes enhance Redis by providing exact-phrase matching, fuzzy search, and numeric filtering, among many other features. Such as:\n\nFull-Text indexing of multiple fields in Redis hashes\nIncremental indexing without performance loss\nVector similarity search\nDocument ranking (using tf-idf, with optional user-provided weights)\nField weighting\nComplex boolean queries with AND, OR, and NOT operators\nPrefix matching, fuzzy matching, and exact-phrase queries\nSupport for double-metaphone phonetic matching\nAuto-complete suggestions (with fuzzy prefix suggestions)\nStemming-based query expansion in many languages (using Snowball)\nSupport for Chinese-language tokenization and querying (using Friso)\nNumeric filters and ranges\nGeospatial searches using Redis geospatial indexing\nA powerful aggregations engine\nSupports for all utf-8 encoded text\nRetrieve full documents, selected fields, or only the document IDs\nSorting results (for example, by creation date)\nJSON support through RedisJSON\n\nClients\n\nGiven the large ecosystem around Redis, there are most likely client libraries in the language you need. You can use any standard Redis client library to run RediSearch commands, but it's easiest to use a library that wraps the RediSearch API. Below are a few examples, but you can find more client libraries here.\n\n| Project | Language | License | Author | Stars |\n|----------|---------|--------|---------|-------|\n| jedis | Java | MIT | Redis | Stars |\n| redis-py | Python | MIT | Redis | Stars |\n| node-redis | Node.js | MIT | Redis | Stars |\n| nredisstack | .NET | MIT | Redis | Stars |\n\n[redis-url]: https://redis.com\n\n[redis-py-url]: https://github.com/redis/redis-py\n[redis-py-stars]: https://img.shields.io/github/stars/redis/redis-py.svg?style=social\u0026amp;label=Star\u0026amp;maxAge=2592000\n[redis-py-package]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis\n\n[jedis-url]: https://github.com/redis/jedis\n[jedis-stars]: https://img.shields.io/github/stars/redis/jedis.svg?style=social\u0026amp;label=Star\u0026amp;maxAge=2592000\n[Jedis-package]: https://search.maven.org/artifact/redis.clients/jedis\n\n[nredisstack-url]: https://github.com/redis/nredisstack\n[nredisstack-stars]: https://img.shields.io/github/stars/redis/nredisstack.svg?style=social\u0026amp;label=Star\u0026amp;maxAge=2592000\n[nredisstack-package]: https://www.nuget.org/packages/nredisstack/\n\n[node-redis-url]: https://github.com/redis/node-redis\n[node-redis-stars]: https://img.shields.io/github/stars/redis/node-redis.svg?style=social\u0026amp;label=Star\u0026amp;maxAge=2592000\n[node-redis-package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis\n\n[redis-om-python-url]: https://github.com/redis/redis-om-python\n[redis-om-python-author]: https://redis.com\n[redis-om-python-stars]: https://img.shields.io/github/stars/redis/redis-om-python.svg?style=social\u0026amp;label=Star\u0026amp;maxAge=2592000\n\n[redisearch-go-url]: https://github.com/RediSearch/redisearch-go\n[redisearch-go-author]: https://redis.com\n[redisearch-go-stars]: https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RediSearch/redisearch-go.svg?style=social\u0026amp;label=Star\u0026amp;maxAge=2592000\n\n[redisearch-api-rs-url]: https://github.com/RediSearch/redisearch-api-rs\n[redisearch-api-rs-author]: https://redis.com\n[redisearch-api-rs-stars]: https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RediSearch/redisearch-api-rs.svg?style=social\u0026amp;label=Star\u0026amp;maxAge=2592000\n\nDeployment Options\n\nThere are many ways to deploy Redis with RediSearch.

This is a common requirement for customers who want to store and search our embeddings with their own data in a secure environment to support production use cases such as chatbots, topic modelling and more.\n\nWhat is a Vector Database\n\nA vector database is a database made to store, manage and search embedding vectors. The use of embeddings to encode unstructured data (text, audio, video and more) as vectors for consumption by machine-learning models has exploded in recent years, due to the increasing effectiveness of AI in solving use cases involving natural language, image recognition and other unstructured forms of data. Vector databases have emerged as an effective solution for enterprises to deliver and scale these use cases.\n\nWhy use a Vector Database\n\nVector databases enable enterprises to take many of the embeddings use cases we've shared in this repo (question and answering, chatbot and recommendation services, for example), and make use of them in a secure, scalable environment. Many of our customers make embeddings solve their problems at small scale but performance and security hold them back from going into production - we see vector databases as a key component in solving that, and in this guide we'll walk through the basics of embedding text data, storing it in a vector database and using it for semantic search.\n\nDemo Flow\nThe demo flow is:\nSetup**: Import packages and set any required variables\nLoad data**: Load a dataset and embed it using OpenAI embeddings\nRedis**\n    Setup: Set up the Redis-Py client.

You most likely already know Redis. What you might not be aware of is the RediSearch module. Enterprises have been using Redis with the RediSearch module for years now across all major cloud providers, Redis Cloud, and on premise. Recently, the Redis team added vector storage and search capability to this module in addition to the features RediSearch already had.\n\nGiven the large ecosystem around Redis, there are most likely client libraries in the language you need.

The easiest way to get started is to use Docker, but there are are many potential options for deployment. For other deployment options, see the redis directory in this repo.\n\nFor this tutorial, we will use Redis Stack on Docker.\n\nStart a version of Redis with RediSearch (Redis Stack) by running the following docker command\n\n$ cd redis\n$ docker compose up -d\nThis also includes the RedisInsight GUI for managing your Redis database which you can view at http://localhost:8001 once you start the docker container.\n\nYou're all set up and ready to go! Next, we import and create our client for communicating with the Redis database we just created.\nCreating a Search Index\n\nThe below cells will show how to specify and create a search index in Redis. We will\n\nSet some constants for defining our index like the distance metric and the index name\nDefine the index schema with RediSearch fields\nCreate the index\n\nLoad Documents into the Index\n\nNow that we have a search index, we can load documents into it. We will use the same documents we used in the previous examples. In Redis, either the Hash or JSON (if using RedisJSON in addition to RediSearch) data types can be used to store documents. We will use the HASH data type in this example. The below cells will show how to load documents into the index.\nRunning Search Queries\n\nNow that we have a search index and documents loaded into it, we can run search queries. Below we will provide a function that will run a search query and return the results. Using this function we run a few queries that will show how you can utilize Redis as a vector database. Each example will demonstrate specific features to keep in mind when developing your search application with Redis.\n\nReturn Fields: You can specify which fields you want to return in the search results. This is useful if you only want to return a subset of the fields in your documents and doesn't require a separate call to retrieve documents. In the below example, we will only return the title field in the search results.\nHybrid Search: You can combine vector search with any of the other RediSearch fields for hybrid search such as full text search, tag, geo, and numeric. In the below example, we will combine vector search with full text search.\n\nHybrid Queries with Redis\n\nThe previous examples showed how run vector search queries with RediSearch. In this section, we will show how to combine vector search with other RediSearch fields for hybrid search. In the below example, we will combine vector search with full text search.\nFor more example with Redis as a vector database, see the README and examples within the `vector_databases/redis` directory of this repository"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"61:T15ac,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis notebook provides an introduction to using Redis as a vector database with OpenAI embeddings.

Compared with traditional vector retrieval services, TairVector has the following advantages:\nStores all data in memory and supports real-time index updates to reduce latency of read and write operations.\nUses an optimized data structure in memory to better utilize storage capacity.\nFunctions as an out-of-the-box data structure in a simple and efficient architecture without complex modules or dependencies.\n\nDeployment options\n\nUsing Tair Cloud Vector Database. Click here to fast deploy it.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nFor the purposes of this exercise we need to prepare a couple of things:\n\nTair cloud server instance.\nThe 'tair' library to interact with the tair database.\nAn OpenAI API key.\n\nInstall requirements\n\nThis notebook obviously requires the openai and tair packages, but there are also some other additional libraries we will use. The following command installs them all:\n\nPrepare your OpenAI API key\n\nThe OpenAI API key is used for vectorization of the documents and queries.\n\nIf you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.\n\nOnce you get your key, please add it by getpass.\nConnect to Tair\nFirst add it to your environment variables.\n\nConnecting to a running instance of Tair server is easy with the official Python library.\nWe can test the connection by ping:\nThe downloaded file has to then be extracted:\nCreate Index\n\nTair stores data in indexes where each object is described by one key. Each key contains a vector and multiple attribute_keys.\n\nWe will start with creating two indexes, one for title_vector and one for content_vector, and then we will fill it with our precomputed embeddings.\nLoad data\n\nIn this section we are going to load the data prepared previous to this session, so you don't have to recompute the embeddings of Wikipedia articles with your own credits.\nSearch data\n\nOnce the data is put into Tair we will start querying the collection for the closest vectors. We may provide an additional parameter vector_name to switch from title to content based search. Since the precomputed embeddings were created with text-embedding-3-small OpenAI model, we also have to use it during search."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"65:Tc7e,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"This notebook presents how to implement a Question Answering system with Langchain, Tair as a knowledge based and OpenAI embeddings.

All the data will be used to create a Langchain application with Tair being the knowledge base.\nChain definition\n\nLangchain is already integrated with Tair and performs all the indexing for given list of documents. In our case we are going to store the set of answers we have.\nAt this stage all the possible answers are already stored in Tair, so we can define the whole QA chain.\nSearch data\n\nOnce the data is put into Tair we can start asking some questions. A question will be automatically vectorized by OpenAI model, and the created vector will be used to find some possibly matching answers in Tair. Once retrieved, the most similar answers will be incorporated into the prompt sent to OpenAI Large Language Model.\n\nCustom prompt templates\n\nThe stuff chain type in Langchain uses a specific prompt with question and context documents incorporated. This is what the default prompt looks like:\n\nUse the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n{context}\nQuestion: {question}\nHelpful Answer:\n\nWe can, however, provide our prompt template and change the behaviour of the OpenAI LLM, while still using the stuff chain type.

The use of embeddings to encode unstructured data (text, audio, video and more) as vectors for consumption by machine-learning models has exploded in recent years, due to the increasing effectiveness of AI in solving use cases involving natural language, image recognition and other unstructured forms of data. Vector databases have emerged as an effective solution for enterprises to deliver and scale these use cases.\n\nWhy use a Vector Database\n\nVector databases enable enterprises to take many of the embeddings use cases we've shared in this repo (question and answering, chatbot and recommendation services, for example), and make use of them in a secure, scalable environment. Many of our customers make embeddings solve their problems at small scale but performance and security hold them back from going into production - we see vector databases as a key component in solving that, and in this guide we'll walk through the basics of embedding text data, storing it in a vector database and using it for semantic search.\n\nDemo Flow\nThe demo flow is:\nSetup**: Import packages and set any required variables\nLoad data**: Load a dataset and embed it using OpenAI embeddings\nTypesense**\n    Setup: Set up the Typesense Python client.

It also lets you combine attribute-based filtering together with vector queries.\n\nFor this example, we will set up a local docker-based Typesense server, index our vectors in Typesense and then do some nearest-neighbor search queries. If you use Typesense Cloud, you can skip the docker setup part and just obtain the hostname and API keys from your cluster dashboard.\nSetup\n\nTo run Typesense locally, you'll need Docker.

This allows for combining vector search with structured filtering.\n\nWeaviate uses KNN algorithms to create an vector-optimized index, which allows your queries to run extremely fast. Learn more here.\n\nWeaviate let you use your favorite ML-models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects.\n\nDeployment options\n\nWhatever your scenario or production setup, Weaviate has an option for you. You can deploy Weaviate in the following setups:\nSelf-hosted – you can deploy Weaviate with docker locally, or any server you want.\nSaaS – you can use Weaviate Cloud Service (WCS) to host your Weaviate instances.\nHybrid-SaaS – you can deploy Weaviate in your own private Cloud Service\n\nProgramming languages\n\nWeaviate offers four client libraries, which allow you to communicate from your apps:\nPython\nJavaScript\nJava\nGo\n\nAdditionally, Weaviate has a REST layer. Basically you can call Weaviate from any language that supports REST requests.\nDemo Flow\nThe demo flow is:\nPrerequisites Setup**: Create a Weaviate instance and install required libraries\nConnect**: Connect to your Weaviate instance\nSchema Configuration**: Configure the schema of your data\n    Note: Here we can define which OpenAI Embedding Model to use\n    Note: Here we can configure which properties to index\nImport data**: Load a demo dataset and import it into Weaviate\n    Note: The import process will automatically index your data - based on the configuration in the schema\n    Note: You don't need to explicitly vectorize your data, Weaviate will communicate with OpenAI to do it for you\nRun Queries**: Query\n    Note: You don't need to explicitly vectorize your queries, Weaviate will communicate with OpenAI to do it for you\n    Note: The qna-openai module automatically communicates with the OpenAI completions endpoint\n\nOnce you've run through this notebook you should have a basic understanding of how to setup and use vector databases for question answering.\nOpenAI Module in Weaviate\nAll Weaviate instances come equipped with the text2vec-openai and the qna-openai modules.\n\nThe first module is responsible for handling vectorization at import (or any CRUD operations) and when you run a search query. The second module communicates with the OpenAI completions endpoint.\n\nNo need to manually vectorize data\nThis is great news for you. With text2vec-openai you don't need to manually vectorize your data, as Weaviate will call OpenAI for you whenever necessary.\n\nAll you need to do is:\nprovide your OpenAI API Key – when you connected to the Weaviate Client\ndefine which OpenAI vectorizer to use in your Schema\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore we start this project, we need setup the following:\n\ncreate a Weaviate instance\ninstall libraries\n    weaviate-client\n    datasets\n    apache-beam\nget your OpenAI API key\n\nCreate a Weaviate instance\n\nTo create a Weaviate instance we have 2 options:\n\n(Recommended path) Weaviate Cloud Service – to host your Weaviate instance in the cloud.

However, if your task involves logical reasoning or complexity, consider trying the techniques in this article to build more reliable, high-performing prompts.\n\nWhy GPT-3 fails on complex tasks\n\nIf you were asked to multiply 13 by 17, would the answer pop immediately into your mind? For most of us, probably not. Yet, that doesn't mean humans are incapable of two-digit multiplication. With a few seconds, and some pen and paper, it's not too taxing to work out that 13 x 17 = 130 + 70 + 21 = 221.\n\nSimilarly, if you give GPT-3 a task that's too complex to do in the time it takes to calculate its next token, it may confabulate an incorrect guess. Yet, akin to humans, that doesn't necessarily mean the model is incapable of the task. With some time and space to reason things out, the model still may be able to answer reliably.\n\nAs an example, if you ask gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct the following math problem about juggling balls, it answers incorrectly:\n\nQ: A juggler has 16 balls. Half of the balls are golf balls and half of the golf balls are blue. How many blue golf balls are there?\nA:\n\nThere are 8 blue golf balls.\n\nDoes this mean that GPT-3 cannot do simple math problems? No; in fact, it turns out that by prompting the model with Let's think step by step, the model solves the problem reliably:\n\nQ: A juggler has 16 balls. Half of the balls are golf balls and half of the golf balls are blue. How many blue golf balls are there?\nA: Let's think step by step.\n\nThere are 16 balls in total.\nHalf of the balls are golf balls.\nThat means that there are 8 golf balls.\nHalf of the golf balls are blue.\nThat means that there are 4 blue golf balls.\n\nOf course, it's hard to tell from only a single example whether this Let's think step by step trick actually works in general or just got lucky on this particular problem. But it really does work. On a benchmark of word math problems, the Let's think step by step trick raised GPT-3's solve rate massively, from a worthless 18% to a decent 79%!\n\nModel capabilities depend on context\n\nWhen learning to work with GPT-3, one common conceptual mistake is to believe that its capabilities are fixed across all contexts. E.g., if GPT-3 gets a simple logic question wrong, then it must be incapable of simple logic.\n\nBut as the Let's think step by step example illustrates, apparent failures of GPT-3 can sometimes be remedied with a better prompt that helps the model steer itself toward the correct output.\n\nHow to improve reliability on complex tasks\n\nThe rest of this article shares techniques for improving reliability of large language models on complex tasks. Although some of the techniques are specific to certain types of problems, many of them are built upon general principles that can be applied to a wide range of tasks, e.g.:\n\nGive clearer instructions\nSplit complex tasks into simpler subtasks\nStructure the instruction to keep the model on task\nPrompt the model to explain before answering\nAsk for justifications of many possible answers, and then synthesize\nGenerate many outputs, and then use the model to pick the best one\nFine-tune custom models to maximize performance\n\nSplit complex tasks into simpler tasks\n\nOne way to give a model more time and space to think is to break tasks into simpler pieces.\n\nAs an example, consider a task where we ask the model a multiple-choice question about some text - in this case, a game of Clue. When asked directly, gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct isn't able to put clues 3 \u0026 5 together, and answers incorrectly:\n\nUse the following clues to answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nClues:\nMiss Scarlett was the only person in the lounge.\nThe person with the pipe was in the kitchen.\nColonel Mustard was the only person in the observatory.\nProfessor Plum was not in the library nor the billiard room.\nThe person with the candlestick was in the observatory.\n\nQuestion: Was Colonel Mustard in the observatory with the candlestick?\n(a) Yes; Colonel Mustard was in the observatory with the candlestick\n(b) No; Colonel Mustard was not in the observatory with the candlestick\n(c) Unknown; there is not enough information to determine whether Colonel Mustard was in the observatory with the candlestick\n\nSolution:\n\n(c) Unknown; there is not enough information to determine whether Colonel Mustard was in the observatory with the candlestick\n\nAlthough clues 3 and 5 establish that Colonel Mustard was the only person in the observatory and that the person in the observatory had the candlestick, the model fails to combine them into a correct answer of (a) Yes.\n\nHowever, instead of asking for the answer directly, we can split the task into three pieces:\n\nFirst, go through the clues one by one and consider whether the clue is potentially relevant\nSecond, combine the relevant clues to reason out the answer to the question\nThird, write the final answer: either (a), (b), or (c)\n\nUse the following clues to answer the following multiple-choice question, using the following procedure:\n(1) First, go through the clues one by one and consider whether the clue is potentially relevant\n(2) Second, combine the relevant clues to reason out the answer to the question\n(3) Third, map the answer to one of the multiple choice answers: either (a), (b), or (c)\n\nClues:\nMiss Scarlett was the only person in the lounge.\nThe person with the pipe was in the kitchen.\nColonel Mustard was the only person in the observatory.\nProfessor Plum was not in the library nor the billiard room.\nThe person with the candlestick was in the observatory.\n\nQuestion: Was Colonel Mustard in the observatory with the candlestick?\n(a) Yes; Colonel Mustard was in the observatory with the candlestick\n(b) No; Colonel Mustard was not in the observatory with the candlestick\n(c) Unknown; there is not enough information to determine whether Colonel Mustard was in the observatory with the candlestick\n\nSolution:\n(1) First, go through the clues one by one and consider whether the clue is potentially relevant:\n\nClue 1: Miss Scarlett was the only person in the lounge. This clue is not relevant.\nClue 2: The person with the pipe was in the kitchen. This clue is not relevant.\nClue 3: Colonel Mustard was the only person in the observatory. This clue is relevant.\nClue 4: Professor Plum was not in the library nor the billiard room. This clue is not relevant.\nClue 5: The person with the candlestick was in the observatory. This clue is relevant.\n\n(2) Second, combine the relevant clues to reason out the answer to the question:\nClue 3 and Clue 5 both say that the person with the candlestick was in the observatory. Colonel Mustard was the only person in the observatory, so Colonel Mustard was the person with the candlestick.\n\n(3) Third, write the final answer:\n(a) Yes; Colonel Mustard was in the observatory with the candlestick\n\nBy giving the model more time and space to think, and guiding it along a reasoning plan, it's able to figure out the correct answer of (a) Yes.\n\nAnother benefit of splitting complex instructions into smaller subtasks is that it can help keep the model focused on each subtask.\n\nFor example, if we ask gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct to summarize a text in its original language, the model can lapse back into English:\n\nSummarize the text using the original language of the text. The summary should be one sentence long.\n\nText:\n\"\"\"\nLa estadística (la forma femenina del término alemán Statistik, derivado a su vez del italiano statista, \"hombre de Estado\")​ es una ciencia que estudia la variabilidad, colección, organización, análisis, interpretación, y presentación de los datos, así como el proceso aleatorio que los genera siguiendo las leyes de la probabilidad.​ La estadística es una ciencia formal deductiva, con un conocimiento propio, dinámico y en continuo desarrollo obtenido a través del método científico formal.

Second, summarize the text using the original language of the text. The summary should be one sentence long.\n\nText:\n\"\"\"\nLa estadística (la forma femenina del término alemán Statistik, derivado a su vez del italiano statista, \"hombre de Estado\")​ es una ciencia que estudia la variabilidad, colección, organización, análisis, interpretación, y presentación de los datos, así como el proceso aleatorio que los genera siguiendo las leyes de la probabilidad.​ La estadística es una ciencia formal deductiva, con un conocimiento propio, dinámico y en continuo desarrollo obtenido a través del método científico formal.

By 'thinking aloud' the model can be far more likely to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nZero-shot\n\nMethod\n\nPublished by Takeshi Kojima et al. in 2022, the easiest way to prompt a model to reason out the answer is to simply prepend answers with Let's think step by step. Figure 2 illustrates an example:\n\nzero-shot reasoning example\nSource: Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners by Takeshi Kojima et al. (2022).\n\nResults\n\nApplying this simple trick to the MultiArith math dataset, the authors found Let's think step by step quadrupled the accuracy, from 18% to 79%!\n\nzero-shot reasoning example\nSource: Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners by Takeshi Kojima et al. (2022).\n\nImplications\n\nAlthough the Let's think step by step trick works well on math problems, it's not effective on all tasks. The authors found that it was most helpful for multi-step arithmetic problems, symbolic reasoning problems, strategy problems, and other reasoning problems. It didn't help with simple math problems or common sense questions, and presumably wouldn't help with many other non-reasoning tasks either.\n\nzero-shot reasoning example\nSource: Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners by Takeshi Kojima et al. (2022).\n\nTo learn more, read the full paper.\n\nIf you apply this technique to your own tasks, don't be afraid to experiment with customizing the instruction. Let's think step by step is rather generic, so you may find better performance with instructions that hew to a stricter format customized to your use case. For example, you can try more structured variants like First, think step by step about why X might be true. Second, think step by step about why Y might be true. Third, think step by step about whether X or Y makes more sense.. And you can even give the model an example format to help keep it on track, e.g.:\n\nUsing the IRS guidance below, answer the following questions using this format:\n(1) For each criterion, determine whether it is met by the vehicle purchase\n{Criterion} Let's think step by step. {explanation} {yes or no, or if the question does not apply then N/A}.\n(2) After considering each criterion in turn, phrase the final answer as \"Because of {reasons}, the answer is likely {yes or no}.\"\n\nIRS guidance:\n\"\"\"\nYou may be eligible for a federal tax credit under Section 30D if you purchased a car or truck that meets the following criteria:\nDoes the vehicle have at least four wheels?\nDoes the vehicle weigh less than 14,000 pounds?\nDoes the vehicle draw energy from a battery with at least 4 kilowatt hours that may be recharged from an external source?\nWas the vehicle purchased in a year before 2022?\n  If so, has the manufacturer sold less than 200,000 qualifying vehicles?

The Toyota Prius Prime weighs less than 14,000 pounds, so the answer is yes.\nDoes the vehicle draw energy from a battery with at least 4 kilowatt hours that may be recharged from an external source? Let's think step by step. The Toyota Prius Prime has a battery with at least 4 kilowatt hours that may be recharged from an external source, so the answer is yes.\nWas the vehicle purchased in a year before 2022? Let's think step by step. The Toyota Prius Prime was purchased in 2021, which is before 2022, so the answer is yes.\nWas the vehicle purchased in a year after 2022?

N/A\n\n(2) After considering each criterion in turn, phrase the final answer as \"Because of {reasons}, the answer is likely {yes or no}.\"\n\nBecause the Toyota Prius Prime meets all of the criteria for a federal tax credit, the answer is likely yes.\n\nFew-shot examples\n\nMethod\n\nPrompting the model to reason out its answers can be done in many ways. One way is to demonstrate with a few examples ('few-shot'), as studied by Jason Wei and Denny Zhou et al. from Google.

In most cases, not many examples were need to saturate the performance gains (less than 8 or so).\n\nchain of thought example\nSource: Chain of Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models Jason Wei and Denny Zhou et al. (2022)\n\nTo learn more, read the full paper.\n\nImplications\n\nOne advantage of the few-shot example-based approach relative to the Let's think step by step technique is that you can more easily specify the format, length, and style of reasoning that you want the model to perform before landing on its final answer. This can be particularly helpful in cases where the model isn't initially reasoning in the right way or depth.\n\nFine-tuned\n\nMethod\n\nIn general, to eke out maximum performance on a task, you'll need to fine-tune a custom model. However, fine-tuning a model using explanations may take thousands of example explanations, which are costly to write.\n\nIn 2022, Eric Zelikman and Yuhuai Wu et al. published a clever procedure for using a few-shot prompt to generate a dataset of explanations that could be used to fine-tune a model. The idea is to use a few-shot prompt to generate candidate explanations, and only keep the explanations that produce the correct answer. Then, to get additional explanations for some of the incorrect answers, retry the few-shot prompt but with correct answers given as part of the question. The authors called their procedure STaR (Self-taught Reasoner):\n\nSTaR procedure\nSource: STaR: Bootstrapping Reasoning With Reasoning by Eric Zelikman and Yujuai Wu et al. (2022)\n\nWith this technique, you can combine the benefits of fine-tuning with the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting without needing to write thousands of example explanations.\n\nResults\n\nWhen the authors applied this technique to a Common Sense Q\u0026A dataset, they found that STaR outperformed both chain-of-thought prompting alone (73% \u003e 37%) and fine-tuning alone (73% \u003e 60%):\n\nSTaR results\nSource: STaR: Bootstrapping Reasoning With Reasoning by Eric Zelikman and Yujuai Wu et al. (2022)\n\nTo learn more, read the full paper.\n\nImplications\n\nUsing a few-shot prompt to extend or modify a fine-tuning dataset is an idea that can be generalized beyond explanation writing. For example, if you have large quantities of unstructured text that you want to train on, you may find opportunities to use a prompt to extract a structured dataset from your unstructured text, and then fine-tune a custom model on that structured dataset.\n\nExtensions to chain-of-thought prompting\n\nA number of extensions of chain-of-thought prompting have been published as well.\n\nSelection-inference prompting\n\nMethod\n\nPublished by Antonia Creswell et al., one extension of the chain-of-thought technique is to split the single prompt for generating explanations and answers into smaller parts. First, a prompt selects a relevant subset of facts from the text ('selection prompt'). Then, a second prompt infers a conclusion from the selected facts ('inference prompt'). These prompts are then alternated in a loop to generate multiple steps of reasoning and eventually land on a final answer. The authors illustrate the idea in the following figure:\n\nSelection-inference prompting\nSource: Selection-Inference: Exploiting Large Language Models for Interpretable Logical Reasoning by Antonia Creswell et al. (2022)\n\nResults\n\nWhen applied to a 7B-parameter model, the authors found that selection-inference prompting substantially improved performance relative to chain-of-thought prompting on the bAbi and Proof Writer benchmark tasks (both of which require longer sequences of reasoning steps). The best performance they achieved combined both selection-inference prompting with fine-tuning.\n\nSelection-inference prompting\nSource: Selection-Inference: Exploiting Large Language Models for Interpretable Logical Reasoning by Antonia Creswell et al. (2022)\n\nImplications\n\nAlthough the gains on these benchmarks were large, these benchmarks were specifically chosen because they required longer sequences of reasoning. On problems that don't require reasoning with many steps, the gains are likely smaller.\n\nThe results highlight a couple of general lessons for working with large language models. One, splitting up complex tasks into smaller tasks is a great way to improve reliability and performance; the more atomic the task, the less room there is for the model to err. Two, getting maximum performance often means combining fine-tuning with whatever approach you've chosen.\n\nTo learn more, read the full paper.\n\nFaithful reasoning architecture\n\nA few months after publishing the selection-inference prompting technique, the authors extended the technique in a follow-up paper, with ideas for:\n\nfiguring out when the selection-inference cycle should stop or continue\nadding a value function to help search over multiple reasoning paths\nreducing hallucination of fake facts by fine-tuning a model to reason about sentence labels (e.g., sen1) rather than writing out the sentences themselves\n\nMethod\n\nIn the original selection-inference technique, specialized 'selection' and 'inference' prompts are alternated to select facts and make inferences from those facts, combining to generate a sequence of reasoning steps.\n\nThe authors extend this technique with two additional components.\n\nFirst, the authors add a 'halter' model that, after each inference step, is asked whether the inferences thus far are sufficient to answer the question. If yes, then the model generates a final answer.\n\nThe halter models brings a couple of advantages:\n\nit can tell the selection-inference process to stop or keep going, as necessary.\nif the process never halts, you'll get no answer, which is often preferable to a hallucinated guess\n\nFaithful reasoning\nSource: Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models by Antonia Creswell et al. (2022)\n\nFaithful reasoning\nSource: Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models by Antonia Creswell et al. (2022)\n\nSecond, the authors add a value function, which is used to assess the quality of reasoning steps and search over multiple reasoning trajectories. This echoes a common theme for increasing reliability; instead of generating a single answer from the model, generate a set of answers and then use some type of value function / discriminator / verifier model to pick the best one.\n\nFaithful reasoning\nSource: Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models by Antonia Creswell et al. (2022)\n\nIn addition to these two extensions, the authors also use a trick to reduce hallucination of fake facts. Rather than asking the model to write out factual sentences, they fine-tune a model to work with sentence labels (e.g., sen1) instead. This helps prevent the model from hallucinating fake facts not mentioned in the prompt context.\n\nFaithful reasoning\nSource: Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models by Antonia Creswell et al. (2022)\n\nResults\n\nThe authors evaluated their technique on two benchmarks: the ProofWriter task (not shown) and EntailmentBankQA (shown). The technique increased accuracy substantially, especially on harder reasoning problems.\n\nFaithful reasoning\nSource: Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models by Antonia Creswell et al.

(2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14271)\n\nImplications\n\nThis paper illustrates a number of helpful lessons for improving the reliability of large language models:\n\nSplit complex tasks into smaller, more reliable subtasks\nGenerate your answer in a step-by-step fashion, evaluating it along the way\nGenerate many possible answers and use another model or function to pick the ones that look best\nReduce hallucination by constraining what the model can say (e.g., by using sentence labels instead of sentences)\nMaximize performance of models by fine-tuning them on specialized tasks\n\nTo learn more, read the full paper.\n\nLeast-to-most prompting\n\nIn addition to doing poorly on long reasoning chains (where selection-inference shines), chain-of-thought prompting can especially struggle when the examples are short but the task is long.\n\nMethod\n\nLeast-to-most prompting is another technique that splits up reasoning tasks into smaller, more reliable subtasks. The idea is to elicit a subtask from the model by prompting it with something like To solve {question}, we need to first solve: \". Then, with that subtask in hand, the model can generate a solution. The solution is appended to the original question and the process is repeated until a final answer is produced.\n\nLeast-to-most prompting\nSource: Least-to-most Prompting Enables Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models by Denny Zhou et al. (2022)\n\nResults\n\nWhen applied to benchmarks involving long reasoning chains using code-davinci-002 (which is optimized for code but can still understand text), the authors measured gains as large as 16% -\u003e 99.7%!\n\n\nLeast-to-most prompting results on last-letter-concatenation task\nLeast-to-most prompting results on SCAN\nLeast-to-most prompting results on DROP numerical reasoning\nSource: Least-to-most Prompting Enables Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models by Denny Zhou et al. (2022)\n\nImplications\n\nAlthough the above gains from least-to-most prompting are impressive, they are measured on a very narrow set of tasks that require long reasoning chains.\n\nStill, they illustrate a common theme: increase reliability by (a) breaking complex tasks into smaller subtasks and (b) giving the model more time and space to work out the answer.\n\nTo learn more, read the full paper.\n\nRelated ideas\n\nMaieutic prompting\n\nMethod\n\nIn contrast to the previous techniques, which try to maximize the likelihood of correct answers, another approach is to use GPT-3 to generate a tree of possible explanations (both correct and incorrect), and then analyze their relationships to guess at which set is correct. This technique was coined maieutic prompting by Jaehun Jung et al. in May 2022 (maieutic means relating to the Socratic method of asking questions to elicit ideas).\n\nThe method is complicated, and works as follows:\n\nFirst, build a maieutic tree, where each node is a statement that could be true or false:\n  Start with a multiple-choice question or true/false statement (e.g. War cannot have a tie)\n  For each possible answer to the question, use the model to generate a corresponding explanation (with a prompt like War cannot have a tie? True, because)\n  Then, prompt the model with the question and the generated explanation, and ask it to produce the answer. If reversing the explanation (with a prefix like It is wrong to say that {explanation}) reverses the answer, then the explanation is considered 'logically integral.'\n  If an explanation is not logically integral, then repeat the above process recursively, with each explanation turned into a True or False question, and generate more explanations for each new question.\n  After all of the recursive explaining is done, you end up with a tree of explanations, where each leaf on the tree has the property that reversing the explanation reverses the model's answer.\nSecond, convert the tree into a graph of relations:\n  For each node in the tree, calculate the model's relative belief in each node (inferred from the probability of getting an answer of True to given an explanation)\n  For each pair of nodes in the tree, use the model to identify whether they are entailed (implied) or contradicted\nThird, find the most consistent set of beliefs and take those to be true:\n  Specifically, using the strength of belief in each node and the logical relationships between them, formulate the problem as a weighted maximum satisfiability problem (MAX-SAT)\n  Use a solver to the find the most self-consistent set of beliefs, and take those as true\n\n\nMaieutic prompting\nMaieutic prompting\nSource: Maieutic Prompting: Logically Consistent Reasoning with Recursive Explanations by Jaehun Jung et al. (2022)\n\nResults\n\nMaieutic prompting results\nSource: Maieutic Prompting: Logically Consistent Reasoning with Recursive Explanations by Jaehun Jung et al. (2022)\n\nImplications\n\nBeyond the complexity, one limitation of this method is that it appears to only apply to questions that can be posed as multiple-choice.\n\nTo learn more, read the full paper.\n\nExtensions\n\nSelf-consistency\n\nMethod\n\nFor tasks with a discrete set of answers, one simple way to improve reliability is to sample multiple explanations \u0026 answers from the model (using a positive temperature) and then pick the final answer that appears most often.\n\nSelf-consistency method\nSource: Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models by Xuezhi Wang et al. (2022)\n\nResults\n\nThis technique lifted accuracies by anywhere from 1 to 24 percentage points on a suite of math and reasoning benchmarks. (Plotted below are results from Google's LaMDA model; using Google's larger PaLM model, the baselines were higher but the gains were a bit smaller.)\n\nSelf-consistency results\nSource: Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models by Xuezhi Wang et al. (2022)\n\nImplications\n\nAlthough this technique is simple to implement, it can be costly. Generating a set of 10 answers will increase your costs by 10x.\n\nAlso, as with many of these techniques, it applies only to tasks with a limited set of answers. For open-ended tasks where each answer is unique (such as writing a poem), it's not obvious what it would mean to pick the most common answer.\n\nLastly, this technique ought to be most beneficial when there are multiple paths or phrasings to reach an answer; if there's only one path, then the technique may not help at all. An extreme example: If the task was to generate a single token answer, then taking the most common token from 100 generations would be no different than taking the token with the highest logprobs (which you can get with a single generation at temperature=0).\n\nVerifiers\n\nAnother key technique for improving task performance is to train a verifier or discriminator model to evaluate the outputs of the main generative model. If the discriminator rejects the output, then you can resample the generative model until you get an acceptable output. In many cases, it's easier to judge an answer than it is to create an answer, which helps explain the power of this method.\n\nMethod\n\nIn 2021, OpenAI researchers applied this technique to grade school math problems, using the following procedure:\n\nFirst, they fine-tuned a model on questions and solutions\nFor each problem in the training set, they generated 100 solutions\nEach of those 100 solutions was automatically labeled as either correct or incorrect, based on whether the final answer was correct\nUsing those solutions, with some labeled correct and some labeled incorrect, they fine-tuned a verifier model to classify whether a question and candidate solution was correct or incorrect\nFinally, at test time, the generative model creates 100 solutions to each problem, and the one with the highest score according to the verifier model is picked as the final answer\n\nVerifier method\nSource: Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems by Karl Cobbe et al. (2021)\n\nResults\n\nWith a 175B GPT-3 model and 8,000 training examples, this technique substantially lifted grade school math accuracy from 33% to 55%.\n\nVerifier results\nSource: Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems by Karl Cobbe et al. (2021)\n\nImplications\n\nSimilar to the self-consistency technique, this method can get expensive, as generating, say, 100 solutions per task will increase your costs by roughly ~100x.\n\nTheories of reliability\n\nAlthough the techniques above vary in their approach, they all share the goal of improving reliability on complex tasks. Mainly they do this by:\n\ndecomposing unreliable operations into smaller, more reliable operations (e.g., selection-inference prompting)\nusing multiple steps or multiple relationships to make the system's reliability greater than any individual component (e.g., maieutic prompting)\n\nProbabilistic graphical models\n\nThis paradigm of trying to build a reliable system out of less reliable components is reminiscent of probabilistic programming, and many of the analysis techniques of that field can be applied to this one.\n\nIn the paper Language Model Cascades, David Dohan et al. interpret the above techniques in the paradigm of probabilistic graphical models:\n\nChain of thought prompting\n\ngraphical model of chain of thought prompting\nSource: Language Model Cascades by David Dohan et al.

(2022)\n\nImplications\n\nAlthough formulating these techniques as probabilistic graphical models may not be immediately useful for solving any particular problem, the framework may be helpful in selecting, combining, and discovering new techniques.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nResearch into large language models is very active and evolving rapidly. Not only do researchers continue to improve the models, they also continue to improve our understanding of how to best employ the models. To underscore the pace of these developments, note that all of the papers shared above were published within the past 12 months (as I write in Sep 2022).\n\nIn the future, expect better models and better techniques to be published. Even if the specific techniques here are eclipsed by future best practices, the general principles behind them will likely remain a key part of any expert user's toolkit.\n\nBibliography\n\n| Lesson                                                                                                                         | Paper                                                                                                                                     | Date     |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| Break complex tasks into simpler subtasks (and consider exposing the intermediate outputs to users)                            | AI Chains: Transparent and Controllable Human-AI Interaction by Chaining Large Language Model Prompts | 2021 Oct |\n| You can improve output by generating many candidates, and then picking the one that looks best                                 | Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems                                                        | 2021 Oct |\n| On reasoning tasks, models do better when they reason step-by-step before answering                                            | Chain of Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models                                 | 2022 Jan |\n| You can improve step-by-step reasoning by generating many explanation-answer outputs, and picking the most popular answer      | Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models                               | 2022 Mar |\n| If you want to fine-tune a step-by-step reasoner, you can do it with multiple-choice question \u0026 answer data alone              | STaR: Bootstrapping Reasoning With Reasoning                                                          | 2022 Mar |\n| The step-by-step reasoning method works great even with zero examples                                                          | Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners                                                         | 2022 May |\n| You can do better than step-by-step reasoning by alternating a ‘selection’ prompt and an ‘inference’ prompt                    | Selection-Inference: Exploiting Large Language Models for Interpretable Logical Reasoning             | 2022 May |\n| On long reasoning problems, you can improve step-by-step reasoning by splitting the problem into pieces to solve incrementally | Least-to-most Prompting Enables Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models                            | 2022 May |\n| You can have the model analyze both good and bogus explanations to figure out which set of explanations are most consistent    | Maieutic Prompting: Logically Consistent Reasoning with Recursive Explanations                        | 2022 May |\n| You can think about these techniques in terms of probabilistic programming, where systems comprise unreliable components       | Language Model Cascades                                                                               | 2022 Jul |\n| You can eliminate hallucination with sentence label manipulation, and you can reduce wrong answers with a 'halter' prompt      | Faithful Reasoning Using Large Language Models                                                        | 2022 Aug |\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"71:T1e4c,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nHow large language models work\n\nLarge language models are functions that map text to text. Given an input string of text, a large language model predicts the text that should come next.\n\nThe magic of large language models is that by being trained to minimize this prediction error over vast quantities of text, the models end up learning concepts useful for these predictions. For example, they learn:\n\nhow to spell\nhow grammar works\nhow to paraphrase\nhow to answer questions\nhow to hold a conversation\nhow to write in many languages\nhow to code\netc.\n\nThey do this by “reading” a large amount of existing text and learning how words tend to appear in context with other words, and uses what it has learned to predict the next most likely word that might appear in response to a user request, and each subsequent word after that.\n\nGPT-3 and GPT-4 power many software products, including productivity apps, education apps, games, and more.\n\nHow to control a large language model\n\nOf all the inputs to a large language model, by far the most influential is the text prompt.\n\nLarge language models can be prompted to produce output in a few ways:\n\nInstruction**: Tell the model what you want\nCompletion**: Induce the model to complete the beginning of what you want\nScenario**: Give the model a situation to play out\nDemonstration**: Show the model what you want, with either:\n  A few examples in the prompt\n  Many hundreds or thousands of examples in a fine-tuning training dataset\n\nAn example of each is shown below.\n\nInstruction prompts\n\nWrite your instruction at the top of the prompt (or at the bottom, or both), and the model will do its best to follow the instruction and then stop. Instructions can be detailed, so don't be afraid to write a paragraph explicitly detailing the output you want, just stay aware of how many tokens the model can process.\n\nExample instruction prompt:\n\nExtract the name of the author from the quotation below.\n\n“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they're correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”\n― Ted Chiang, Exhalation\n\nOutput:\n\nTed Chiang\n\nCompletion prompt example\n\nCompletion-style prompts take advantage of how large language models try to write text they think is mostly likely to come next. To steer the model, try beginning a pattern or sentence that will be completed by the output you want to see. Relative to direct instructions, this mode of steering large language models can take more care and experimentation. In addition, the models won't necessarily know where to stop, so you will often need stop sequences or post-processing to cut off text generated beyond the desired output.\n\nExample completion prompt:\n\n“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they're correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”\n― Ted Chiang, Exhalation\n\nThe author of this quote is\n\nOutput:\n\n Ted Chiang\n\nScenario prompt example\n\nGiving the model a scenario to follow or role to play out can be helpful for complex queries or when seeking imaginative responses. When using a hypothetical prompt, you set up a situation, problem, or story, and then ask the model to respond as if it were a character in that scenario or an expert on the topic.\n\nExample scenario prompt:\n\nYour role is to extract the name of the author from any given text\n\n“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they're correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”\n― Ted Chiang, Exhalation\n\nOutput:\n\n Ted Chiang\n\nDemonstration prompt example (few-shot learning)\n\nSimilar to completion-style prompts, demonstrations can show the model what you want it to do. This approach is sometimes called few-shot learning, as the model learns from a few examples provided in the prompt.\n\nExample demonstration prompt:\n\nQuote:\n“When the reasoning mind is forced to confront the impossible again and again, it has no choice but to adapt.”\n― N.K. Jemisin, The Fifth Season\nAuthor: N.K. Jemisin\n\nQuote:\n“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they're correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”\n― Ted Chiang, Exhalation\nAuthor:\n\nOutput:\n\n Ted Chiang\n\nFine-tuned prompt example\n\nWith enough training examples, you can fine-tune a custom model. In this case, instructions become unnecessary, as the model can learn the task from the training data provided. However, it can be helpful to include separator sequences (e.g., -\u003e or ### or any string that doesn't commonly appear in your inputs) to tell the model when the prompt has ended and the output should begin. Without separator sequences, there is a risk that the model continues elaborating on the input text rather than starting on the answer you want to see.\n\nExample fine-tuned prompt (for a model that has been custom trained on similar prompt-completion pairs):\n\n“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they're correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”\n― Ted Chiang, Exhalation\n\nOutput:\n\n Ted Chiang\n\nCode Capabilities\n\nLarge language models aren't only great at text - they can be great at code too. OpenAI's GPT-4 model is a prime example.\n\nGPT-4 powers numerous innovative products, including:\n\n[GitHub Copilot] (autocompletes code in Visual Studio and other IDEs)\nReplit (can complete, explain, edit and generate code)\nCursor (build software faster in an editor designed for pair-programming with AI)\n\nGPT-4 is more advanced than previous models like gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct. But, to get the best out of GPT-4 for coding tasks, it's still important to give clear and specific instructions. As a result, designing good prompts can take more care.\n\nMore prompt advice\n\nFor more prompt examples, visit OpenAI Examples.\n\nIn general, the input prompt is the best lever for improving model outputs. You can try tricks like:\n\nBe more specific** E.g., if you want the output to be a comma separated list, ask it to return a comma separated list. If you want it to say \"I don't know\" when it doesn't know the answer, tell it 'Say \"I don't know\" if you do not know the answer.' The more specific your instructions, the better the model can respond.\nProvide Context**: Help the model understand the bigger picture of your request. This could be background information, examples/demonstrations of what you want or explaining the purpose of your task.\nAsk the model to answer as if it was an expert.** Explicitly asking the model to produce high quality output or output as if it was written by an expert can induce the model to give higher quality answers that it thinks an expert would write. Phrases like \"Explain in detail\" or \"Describe step-by-step\" can be effective.\nPrompt the model to write down the series of steps explaining its reasoning.** If understanding the 'why' behind an answer is important, prompt the model to include its reasoning. This can be done by simply adding a line like \"Let's think step by step\" before each answer.\n\n[Fine Tuning Docs]: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning\n[OpenAI Customer Stories]: https://openai.com/customer-stories\n[Large language models Blog Post]: https://openai.com/research/better-language-models\n[GitHub Copilot]: https://github.com/features/copilot/\n[GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo]: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo\n[GPT3 Apps Blog Post]: https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/\n[OpenAI Examples]: https://platform.openai.com/examples\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"72:Tbb8,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThe OpenAI API embeddings endpoint can be used to measure relatedness or similarity between pieces of text.\n\nBy leveraging GPT-3's understanding of text, these embeddings achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in unsupervised learning and transfer learning settings.\n\nEmbeddings can be used for semantic search, recommendations, cluster analysis, near-duplicate detection, and more.\n\nFor more information, read OpenAI's blog post announcements:\n\nIntroducing Text and Code Embeddings (Jan 2022)\nNew and Improved Embedding Model (Dec 2022)\n\nFor comparison with other embedding models, see Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard\n\nSemantic search\n\nEmbeddings can be used for search either by themselves or as a feature in a larger system.\n\nThe simplest way to use embeddings for search is as follows:\n\nBefore the search (precompute):\n  Split your text corpus into chunks smaller than the token limit (8,191 tokens for text-embedding-3-small)\n  Embed each chunk of text\n  Store those embeddings in your own database or in a vector search provider like Pinecone, Weaviate or Qdrant\nAt the time of the search (live compute):\n  Embed the search query\n  Find the closest embeddings in your database\n  Return the top results\n\nAn example of how to use embeddings for search is shown in Semantic_text_search_using_embeddings.ipynb.\n\nIn more advanced search systems, the cosine similarity of embeddings can be used as one feature among many in ranking search results.\n\nQuestion answering\n\nThe best way to get reliably honest answers from GPT-3 is to give it source documents in which it can locate correct answers. Using the semantic search procedure above, you can cheaply search through a corpus of documents for relevant information and then give that information to GPT-3 via the prompt to answer a question. We demonstrate this in Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb.\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecommendations are quite similar to search, except that instead of a free-form text query, the inputs are items in a set.\n\nAn example of how to use embeddings for recommendations is shown in Recommendation_using_embeddings.ipynb.\n\nSimilar to search, these cosine similarity scores can either be used on their own to rank items or as features in larger ranking algorithms.\n\nCustomizing Embeddings\n\nAlthough OpenAI's embedding model weights cannot be fine-tuned, you can nevertheless use training data to customize embeddings to your application.\n\nIn Customizing_embeddings.ipynb, we provide an example method for customizing your embeddings using training data. The idea of the method is to train a custom matrix to multiply embedding vectors by in order to get new customized embeddings. With good training data, this custom matrix will help emphasize the features relevant to your training labels. You can equivalently consider the matrix multiplication as (a) a modification of the embeddings or (b) a modification of the distance function used to measure the distances between embeddings.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"73:T1b2e,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nPeople are writing great tools and papers for improving outputs from GPT.

This could serve as a practical guide for ML practitioners, data scientists, and AI Engineers interested in leveraging the power of OpenAI models for specific use-cases. 🤩\n\nWhy should you read this blog?\n\nYou want to learn how to\nFine-tune OpenAI models for specific use-cases\nUse Qdrant to improve the performance of your RAG model\nUse fine-tuning to improve the correctness of your RAG model and reduce hallucinations\n\nTo begin, we've selected a dataset where we've a guarantee that the retrieval is perfect. We've selected a subset of the SQuAD dataset, which is a collection of questions and answers about Wikipedia articles. We've also included samples where the answer is not present in the context, to demonstrate how RAG handles this case.\n\nTable of Contents\nSetting up the Environment\n\nSection A: Zero-Shot Learning\nData Preparation: SQuADv2 Dataset\nAnswering using Base gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 model\nFine-tuning and Answering using Fine-tuned model\nEvaluation: How well does the model perform?\n\nSection B: Few-Shot Learning\n\nUsing Qdrant to Improve RAG Prompt\nFine-Tuning OpenAI Model with Qdrant\nEvaluation\n\nConclusion\n    Aggregate Results\n    Observations\nTerms, Definitions, and References\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?\nThe phrase Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) comes from a recent paper by Lewis et al. from Facebook AI. The idea is to use a pre-trained language model (LM) to generate text, but to use a separate retrieval system to find relevant documents to condition the LM on.\n\nWhat is Qdrant?\nQdrant is an open-source vector search engine that allows you to search for similar vectors in a large dataset. It is built in Rust and here we'll use the Python client to interact with it. This is the Retrieval part of RAG.\n\nWhat is Few-Shot Learning?\nFew-shot learning is a type of machine learning where the model is \"improved\" via training or fine-tuning on a small amount of data. In this case, we'll use it to fine-tune the RAG model on a small number of examples from the SQuAD dataset. This is the Augmented part of RAG.\n\nWhat is Zero-Shot Learning?\nZero-shot learning is a type of machine learning where the model is \"improved\" via training or fine-tuning without any dataset specific information.\n\nWhat is Fine-Tuning?\nFine-tuning is a type of machine learning where the model is \"improved\" via training or fine-tuning on a small amount of data. In this case, we'll use it to fine-tune the RAG model on a small number of examples from the SQuAD dataset. The LLM is what makes the Generation part of RAG.\n1. Setting Up the Environment\n\nInstall and Import Dependencies\nSet your keys\nGet your OpenAI keys here and Qdrant keys after making a free cluster here.\nSection A\n\n2. Data Preparation: SQuADv2 Data Subsets\n\nFor the purpose of demonstration, we'll make small slices from the train and validation splits of the SQuADv2 dataset. This dataset has questions and contexts where the answer is not present in the context, to help us evaluate how LLM handles this case.\n\nWe'll read the data from the JSON files and create a dataframe with the following columns: question, context, answer, is_impossible.\n\nDownload the Data\nRead JSON to DataFrame\n3. Answering using Base gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 model\n\n3.1 Zero Shot Prompt\n\nLet's start by using the base gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 model to answer the questions. This prompt is a simple concatenation of the question and context, with a separator token in between: \\n\\n. We've a simple instruction part of the prompt:\nAnswer the following Question based on the Context only. Only answer from the Context. If you don't know the answer, say 'I don't know'.\n\nOther prompts are possible, but this is a good starting point. We'll use this prompt to answer the questions in the validation set.\n3.2 Answering using Zero Shot Prompt\n\nNext, you'll need some re-usable functions which make an OpenAI API Call and return the answer. You'll use the ChatCompletion.create endpoint of the API, which takes a prompt and returns the completed text.\n⏰ Time to run: ~3 min, 🛜 Needs Internet Connection\n4. Fine-tuning and Answering using Fine-tuned model\n\nFor the complete fine-tuning process, please refer to the OpenAI Fine-Tuning Docs.\n\n4.1 Prepare the Fine-Tuning Data\n\nWe need to prepare the data for fine-tuning. We'll use a few samples from train split of same dataset as before, but we'll add the answer to the context. This will help the model learn to retrieve the answer from the context.\n\nOur instruction prompt is the same as before, and so is the system prompt.\nTip: 💡 Verify the Fine-Tuning Data\n\nYou can see this cookbook for more details on how to prepare the data for fine-tuning.\n\n4.2 Fine-Tune OpenAI Model\n\nIf you're new to OpenAI Model Fine-Tuning, please refer to the How to finetune Chat models notebook. You can also refer to the OpenAI Fine-Tuning Docs for more details.\n⏰ Time to run: ~10-20 minutes, 🛜 Needs Internet Connection\n4.2.1 Try out the Fine-Tuned Model\n\nLet's try out the fine-tuned model on the same validation set as before. You'll use the same prompt as before, but you will use the fine-tuned model instead of the base model. Before you do that, you can make a simple call to get a sense of how the fine-tuned model is doing.\n4.3 Answer Using the Fine-Tuned Model\n\nThis is the same as before, but you'll use the fine-tuned model instead of the base model.\n\n⏰ Time to run: ~5 min, 🛜 Needs Internet Connection\n5. Evaluation: How well does the model perform?\n\nTo evaluate the model's performance, compare the predicted answer to the actual answers -- if any of the actual answers are present in the predicted answer, then it's a match. We've also created error categories to help you understand where the model is struggling.\n\nWhen we know that a correct answer exists in the context, we can measure the model's performance, there are 3 possible outcomes:\n\n✅ Answered Correctly: The model responded the correct answer. It may have also included other answers that were not in the context.\n❎ Skipped: The model responded with \"I don't know\" (IDK) while the answer was present in the context. It's better than giving the wrong answer. It's better for the model say \"I don't know\" than giving the wrong answer. In our design, we know that a true answer exists and hence we're able to measure it -- this is not always the case. This is a model error. We exclude this from the overall error rate.\n❌ Wrong: The model responded with an incorrect answer. This is a model ERROR.\n\nWhen we know that a correct answer does not exist in the context, we can measure the model's performance, there are 2 possible outcomes:\n\n❌ Hallucination: The model responded with an answer, when \"I don't know\" was expected. This is a model ERROR.\n✅ I don't know: The model responded with \"I don't know\" (IDK) and the answer was not present in the context. This is a model WIN.\nNotice that the fine-tuned model skips questions more often -- and makes fewer mistakes. This is because the fine-tuned model is more conservative and skips questions when it's not sure.\nNotice that the fine-tuned model has learnt to say \"I don't know\" a lot better than the prompt. Or, the model has gotten good at skipping questions.\n\nObservations\n\nThe fine-tuned model is better at saying \"I don't know\"\nHallucinations drop from 100% to 15% with fine-tuning\nWrong answers drop from 17% to 6% with fine-tuning\n\nCorrect answers also drop from 83% to 60% with fine-tuning - this is because the fine-tuned model is more conservative and says \"I don't know\" more often. This is a good thing because it's better to say \"I don't know\" than to give a wrong answer.\n\nThat said, we want to improve the correctness of the model, even if that increases the hallucinations. We're looking for a model that is both correct and conservative, striking a balance between the two. We'll use Qdrant and Few-Shot Learning to achieve this.\n💪 You're 2/3rds of the way there! Keep reading!\n\nSection B: Few Shot Learning\n\nWe'll select a few examples from the dataset, including cases where the answer is not present in the context. We'll then use these examples to create a prompt that we can use to fine-tune the model. We'll then measure the performance of the fine-tuned model.\n\nWhat is next?\n\nFine-Tuning OpenAI Model with Qdrant\n    6.1 Embed the Fine-Tuning Data\n    6.2 Embedding the Questions\nUsing Qdrant to Improve RAG Prompt\nEvaluation\n\n6. Fine-Tuning OpenAI Model with Qdrant\n\nSo far, we've been using the OpenAI model to answer questions without using examples of the answer. The previous step made it work better on in-context examples, while this one helps it generalize to unseen data, and attempt to learn when to say \"I don't know\" and when to give an answer.\n\nThis is where few-shot learning comes in!\n\nFew-shot learning is a type of transfer learning that allows us to answer questions where the answer is not present in the context. We can do this by providing a few examples of the answer we're looking for, and the model will learn to answer questions where the answer is not present in the context.\n5.1 Embed the Training Data\n\nEmbeddings are a way to represent sentences as an array of floats. We'll use the embeddings to find the most similar questions to the ones we're looking for.\nNow that we've the Qdrant imports in place,\n5.2 Embedding the Questions\n\nNext, you'll embed the entire training set questions. You'll use the question to question similarity to find the most similar questions to the question we're looking for. This is a workflow which is used in RAG to leverage the OpenAI model ability of incontext learning with more examples. This is what we call Few Shot Learning here.\n\n❗️⏰ Important Note: This step can take up to 3 hours to complete. Please be patient. If you see Out of Memory errors or Kernel Crashes, please reduce the batch size to 32, restart the kernel and run the notebook again. This code needs to be run only ONCE.\n\nFunction Breakdown for generate_points_from_dataframe\n\nInitialization: batch_size = 512 and total_batches set the stage for how many questions will be processed in one go. This is to prevent memory issues. If your machine can handle more, feel free to increase the batch size. If your kernel crashes, reduce the batch size to 32 and try again.\nProgress Bar: tqdm gives you a nice progress bar so you don't fall asleep.\nBatch Loop: The for-loop iterates through batches. start_idx and end_idx define the slice of the DataFrame to process.\nGenerate Embeddings: batch_embeddings = embedding_model.embed(batch, batch_size=batch_size) - This is where the magic happens. Your questions get turned into embeddings.\nPointStruct Generation: Using .progress_apply, it turns each row into a PointStruct object. This includes an ID, the embedding vector, and other metadata.\n\nReturns the list of PointStruct objects, which can be used to create a collection in Qdrant.\nUpload the Embeddings to Qdrant\n\nNote that configuring Qdrant is outside the scope of this notebook. Please refer to the Qdrant for more information. We used a timeout of 600 seconds for the upload, and grpc compression to speed up the upload.\n6. Using Qdrant to Improve RAG Prompt\n\nNow that we've uploaded the embeddings to Qdrant, we can use Qdrant to find the most similar questions to the question we're looking for. We'll use the top 5 most similar questions to create a prompt that we can use to fine-tune the model. We'll then measure the performance of the fine-tuned model on the same validation set, but with few shot prompting!\n\nOur main function get_few_shot_prompt serves as the workhorse for generating prompts for few-shot learning. It does this by retrieving similar questions from Qdrant - a vector search engine, using an embeddings model. Here is the high-level workflow:\n\nRetrieve similar questions from Qdrant where the answer is present in the context\nRetrieve similar questions from Qdrant where the answer is IMPOSSIBLE i.e. the expected answer is \"I don't know\" to find in the context\nCreate a prompt using the retrieved questions\nFine-tune the model using the prompt\nEvaluate the fine-tuned model on the validation set with the same prompting technique\n7. Fine-Tuning OpenAI Model with Qdrant\n\n7.1 Upload the Fine-Tuning Data to OpenAI\n7.2 Fine-Tune the Model\n\n⏰ Time to run: ~15-30 minutes\n⏰ Time to run: 5-15 min\n8. Evaluation\n\nBut how well does the model perform? Let's compare the results from the 3 different models we've looked at so far:\nThis is quite amazing -- we're able to get the best of both worlds! We're able to get the model to be both correct and conservative:\n\nThe model is correct 83% of the time -- this is the same as the base model\nThe model gives the wrong answer only 8% of the time -- down from 17% with the base model\nNext, let's look at the hallucinations. We want to reduce the hallucinations, but not at the cost of correctness. We want to strike a balance between the two. We've struck a good balance here:\n\nThe model hallucinates 53% of the time -- down from 100% with the base model\nThe model says \"I don't know\" 47% of the time -- up from NEVER with the base model\nFew Shot Fine-Tuning with Qdrant is a great way to control and steer the performance of your RAG system. Here, we made the model less conservative compared to zero shot and more confident by using Qdrant to find similar questions.\n\nYou can also use Qdrant to make the model more conservative. We did this by giving examples of questions where the answer is not present in the context.\nThis is biasing the model to say \"I don't know\" more often.\n\nSimilarly, one can also use Qdrant to make the model more confident by giving examples of questions where the answer is present in the context. This biases the model to give an answer more often. The trade-off is that the model will also hallucinate more often.\n\nYou can make this trade off by adjusting the training data: distribution of questions and examples, as well as the kind and number of examples you retrieve from Qdrant.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\nIn this notebook, we've demonstrated how to fine-tune OpenAI models for specific use-cases. We've also demonstrated how to use Qdrant and Few-Shot Learning to improve the performance of the model.\n\nAggregate Results\n\nSo far, we've looked at the results for each scenario separately, i.e. each scenario summed to 100. Let's look at the results as an aggregate to get a broader sense of how the model is performing:\n\n| Category | Base | Fine-Tuned | Fine-Tuned with Qdrant |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Correct | 44% | 32% | 44% |\n| Skipped | 0% | 18% | 5% |\n| Wrong | 9% | 3% | 4% |\n| Hallucination | 47% | 7% | 25% |\n| I don't know | 0% | 40% | 22% |\nObservations\n\nCompared to base model\nThe few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model is as good as the base model at answering questions where the answer is present in the context.\nThe few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model is better at saying \"I don't know\" when the answer is not present in the context.\nThe few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model is better at reducing hallucinations.\n\nCompared to fine-tuned model\nThe few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model gets more correct answers than the fine-tuned model: 83% of the questions are answered correctly vs 60% for the fine-tuned model\nThe few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model is better at deciding when to say \"I don't know\" when the answer is not present in the context. 34% skip rate for the plain fine-tuning mode, vs 9% for the few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model\n\n\nNow, you should be able to:\n\nNotice the trade-offs between number of correct answers and hallucinations -- and how training dataset choice influences that!\nFine-tune OpenAI models for specific use-cases and use Qdrant to improve the performance of your RAG model\nGet started on how to evaluate the performance of your RAG model"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"75:T878,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"This code demonstrates how to interact with ChatGPT functions to perform tasks related to Amazon S3 buckets.

This means that it can, e.g., search the web, send emails, or book tickets on behalf of your users, making it more powerful than a regular chatbot.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will build an app that uses OpenAI functions along with the latest version of the Node.js SDK. The app runs in the browser, so you only need a code editor and, e.g., VS Code Live Server to follow along locally. Alternatively, write your code directly in the browser via this code playground at Scrimba.\n\nWhat you will build\n\nOur app is a simple agent that helps you find activities in your area.\nIt has access to two functions, getLocation() and getCurrentWeather(),\nwhich means it can figure out where you’re located and what the weather\nis at the moment.\n\nAt this point, it's important to understand that\nOpenAI doesn't execute any code for you. It just tells your app which\nfunctions it should use in a given scenario, and then leaves it up to\nyour app to invoke them.\n\nOnce our agent knows your location and the weather, it'll use GPT’s\ninternal knowledge to suggest suitable local activities for you.\n\nImporting the SDK and authenticating with OpenAI\n\nWe start by importing the OpenAI SDK at the top of our JavaScript file and authenticate with our API key, which we have stored as an environment variable.\n\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,\n});\n\nSince we're running our code in a browser environment at Scrimba, we also need to set dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true to confirm we understand the risks involved with client-side API requests. Please note that you should move these requests over to a Node server in a production app.\n\nCreating our two functions\n\nNext, we'll create the two functions. The first one - getLocation -\nuses the IP API to get the location of the\nuser.\n\nasync function getLocation() {\n  const response = await fetch(\"https://ipapi.co/json/\");\n  const locationData = await response.json();\n  return locationData;\n}\n\nThe IP API returns a bunch of data about your location, including your\nlatitude and longitude, which we’ll use as arguments in the second\nfunction getCurrentWeather. It uses the Open Meteo\nAPI to get the current weather data, like\nthis:\n\nasync function getCurrentWeather(latitude, longitude) {\n  const url = https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}\u0026longitude=${longitude}\u0026hourly=apparent_temperature;\n  const response = await fetch(url);\n  const weatherData = await response.json();\n  return weatherData;\n}\n\nDescribing our functions for OpenAI\n\nFor OpenAI to understand the purpose of these functions, we need to\ndescribe them using a specific schema. We'll create an array called\ntools that contains one object per function. Each object\nwill have two keys: type, function, and the function key has\nthree subkeys: name, description, and parameters.\n\nconst tools = [\n  {\n    type: \"function\",\n    function: {\n      name: \"getCurrentWeather\",\n      description: \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n      parameters: {\n        type: \"object\",\n        properties: {\n          latitude: {\n            type: \"string\",\n          },\n          longitude: {\n            type: \"string\",\n          },\n        },\n        required: [\"longitude\", \"latitude\"],\n      },\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    type: \"function\",\n    function: {\n      name: \"getLocation\",\n      description: \"Get the user's location based on their IP address\",\n      parameters: {\n        type: \"object\",\n        properties: {},\n      },\n    }\n  },\n];\n\nSetting up the messages array\n\nWe also need to define a messages array. This will keep track of all of the messages back and forth between our app and OpenAI.\n\nThe first object in the array should always have the role property set to \"system\", which tells OpenAI that this is how we want it to behave.\n\nconst messages = [\n  {\n    role: \"system\",\n    content:\n      \"You are a helpful assistant. Only use the functions you have been provided with.\",\n  },\n];\n\nCreating the agent function\n\nWe are now ready to build the logic of our app, which lives in the\nagent function. It is asynchronous and takes one argument: the\nuserInput.\n\nWe start by pushing the userInput to the messages array. This time, we set the role to \"user\", so that OpenAI knows that this is the input from the user.\n\nasync function agent(userInput) {\n  messages.push({\n    role: \"user\",\n    content: userInput,\n  });\n  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    model: \"gpt-4\",\n    messages: messages,\n    tools: tools,\n  });\n  console.log(response);\n}\n\nNext, we'll send a request to the Chat completions endpoint via the\nchat.completions.create() method in the Node SDK. This method takes a\nconfiguration object as an argument. In it, we'll specify three\nproperties:\n\nmodel - Decides which AI model we want to use (in our case,\n  GPT-4).\nmessages - The entire history of messages between the user and the\n  AI up until this point.\ntools - A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only\n  functions are supported as a tool., we'll we use the tools array we\n  created earlier.\n\nRunning our app with a simple input\n\nLet's try to run the agent with an input that requires a function call to give a suitable reply.\n\nagent(\"Where am I located right now?\");\n\nWhen we run the code above, we see the response from OpenAI logged out\nto the console like this:\n\n{\n    id: \"chatcmpl-84ojoEJtyGnR6jRHK2Dl4zTtwsa7O\",\n    object: \"chat.completion\",\n    created: 1696159040,\n    model: \"gpt-4-0613\",\n    choices: [{\n        index: 0,\n        message: {\n            role: \"assistant\",\n            content: null,\n            tool_calls: [\n              id: \"call_CBwbo9qoXUn1kTR5pPuv6vR1\",\n              type: \"function\",\n              function: {\n                name: \"getLocation\",\n                arguments: \"{}\"\n              }\n            ]\n        },\n        logprobs: null,\n        finish_reason: \"tool_calls\" // OpenAI wants us to call a function\n    }],\n    usage: {\n        prompt_tokens: 134,\n        completion_tokens: 6,\n        total_tokens: 140\n    }\n     system_fingerprint: null\n}\n\nThis response tells us that we should call one of our functions, as it contains the following key: finish_reason: \"tool_calls\".\n\nThe name of the function can be found in the\nresponse.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0].function.name key, which is set to\n\"getLocation\".\n\nTurning the OpenAI response into a function call\n\nNow that we have the name of the function as a string, we'll need to\ntranslate that into a function call. To help us with that, we'll gather\nboth of our functions in an object called availableTools:\n\nconst availableTools = {\n  getCurrentWeather,\n  getLocation,\n};\n\nThis is handy because we'll be able to access the getLocation function\nvia bracket notation and the string we got back from OpenAI, like this:\navailableTools[\"getLocation\"].\n\nconst { finish_reason, message } = response.choices[0];\n\nif (finish_reason === \"tool_calls\" \u0026\u0026 message.tool_calls) {\n  const functionName = message.tool_calls[0].function.name;\n  const functionToCall = availableTools[functionName];\n  const functionArgs = JSON.parse(message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments);\n  const functionArgsArr = Object.values(functionArgs);\n  const functionResponse = await functionToCall.apply(null, functionArgsArr);\n  console.log(functionResponse);\n}\n\nWe're also grabbing ahold of any arguments OpenAI wants us to pass into\nthe function: message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments.\nHowever, we won't need any arguments for this first function call.\n\nIf we run the code again with the same input\n(\"Where am I located right now?\"), we'll see that functionResponse\nis an object filled with location about where the user is located right\nnow. In my case, that is Oslo, Norway.\n\n{ip: \"193.212.60.170\", network: \"193.212.60.0/23\", version: \"IPv4\", city: \"Oslo\", region: \"Oslo County\", region_code: \"03\", country: \"NO\", country_name: \"Norway\", country_code: \"NO\", country_code_iso3: \"NOR\", country_capital: \"Oslo\", country_tld: \".no\", continent_code: \"EU\", in_eu: false, postal: \"0026\", latitude: 59.955, longitude: 10.859, timezone: \"Europe/Oslo\", utc_offset: \"+0200\", country_calling_code: \"+47\", currency: \"NOK\", currency_name: \"Krone\", languages: \"no,nb,nn,se,fi\", country_area: 324220, country_population: 5314336, asn: \"AS2119\", org: \"Telenor Norge AS\"}\n\nWe'll add this data to a new item in the messages array, where we also\nspecify the name of the function we called.\n\nmessages.push({\n  role: \"function\",\n  name: functionName,\n  content: `The result of the last function was this: ${JSON.stringify(\n    functionResponse\n  )}\n  `,\n});\n\nNotice that the role is set to \"function\". This tells OpenAI\nthat the content parameter contains the result of the function call\nand not the input from the user.\n\nAt this point, we need to send a new request to OpenAI with this updated\nmessages array. However, we don’t want to hard code a new function\ncall, as our agent might need to go back and forth between itself and\nGPT several times until it has found the final answer for the user.\n\nThis can be solved in several different ways, e.g. recursion, a\nwhile-loop, or a for-loop. We'll use a good old for-loop for the sake of\nsimplicity.\n\nCreating the loop\n\nAt the top of the agent function, we'll create a loop that lets us run\nthe entire procedure up to five times.\n\nIf we get back finish_reason: \"tool_calls\" from GPT, we'll just\npush the result of the function call to the messages array and jump to\nthe next iteration of the loop, triggering a new request.\n\nIf we get finish_reason: \"stop\" back, then GPT has found a suitable\nanswer, so we'll return the function and cancel the loop.\n\nfor (let i = 0; i\nComplete code\n\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,\n});\n\nasync function getLocation() {\n  const response = await fetch(\"https://ipapi.co/json/\");\n  const locationData = await response.json();\n  return locationData;\n}\n\nasync function getCurrentWeather(latitude, longitude) {\n  const url = https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}\u0026longitude=${longitude}\u0026hourly=apparent_temperature;\n  const response = await fetch(url);\n  const weatherData = await response.json();\n  return weatherData;\n}\n\nconst tools = [\n  {\n    type: \"function\",\n    function: {\n      name: \"getCurrentWeather\",\n      description: \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n      parameters: {\n        type: \"object\",\n        properties: {\n          latitude: {\n            type: \"string\",\n          },\n          longitude: {\n            type: \"string\",\n          },\n        },\n        required: [\"longitude\", \"latitude\"],\n      },\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    type: \"function\",\n    function: {\n      name: \"getLocation\",\n      description: \"Get the user's location based on their IP address\",\n      parameters: {\n        type: \"object\",\n        properties: {},\n      },\n    }\n  },\n];\n\nconst availableTools = {\n  getCurrentWeather,\n  getLocation,\n};\n\nconst messages = [\n  {\n    role: \"system\",\n    content: You are a helpful assistant.

We also delineate the specific set of entity labels we aim to identify.\nAlthough one can instruct the model to format its response, it has to be noted that both gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 have been fine-tuned to discern when a function should be invoked, and to reply with JSON formatted according to the function's signature. This capability streamlines our prompt and enables us to receive structured data directly from the model.\n3.2 Assistant Message\nAssistant messages usually store previous assistant responses. However, as in our scenario, they can also be crafted to provide examples of the desired behavior. While OpenAI is able to execute zero-shot Named Entity Recognition, we have found that a one-shot approach produces more precise results.\n3.3 User Message\nThe user message provides the specific text for the assistant task:\n4. OpenAI Functions (and Utils)\nIn an OpenAI API call, we can describe functions to gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. It's important to note that the chat completions API doesn't actually execute the function. Instead, it provides the JSON output, which can then be used to call the function in our code. For more details, refer to the OpenAI Function Calling Guide.\nOur function, enrich_entities(text, label_entities) gets a block of text and a dictionary containing identified labels and entities as parameters. It then associates the recognized entities with their corresponding links to the Wikipedia articles.\n4. ChatCompletion\nAs previously highlighted, gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 have been fine-tuned to detect when a function should to be called. Moreover, they can produce a JSON response that conforms to the function signature. Here's the sequence we follow:\n\nDefine our function and its associated JSON Schema.\nInvoke the model using the messages, tools and tool_choice parameters.\nConvert the output into a JSON object, and then call the function with the arguments provided by the model.\n\nIn practice, one might want to re-invoke the model again by appending the function response as a new message, and let the model summarize the results back to the user. Nevertheless, for our purposes, this step is not needed.\n\nNote that in a real-case scenario it is strongly recommended to build in user confirmation flows before taking actions.\n4.1 Define our Function and JSON schema\nSince we want the model to output a dictionary of labels and recognized entities:\n\n{\n    \"gpe\": [\"Germany\", \"Europe\"],\n    \"date\": [\"1440\"],\n    \"person\": [\"Johannes Gutenberg\"],\n    \"product\": [\"movable-type printing press\"],\n    \"event\": [\"Renaissance\"],\n    \"quantity\": [\"3,600 pages\"],\n    \"time\": [\"workday\"]\n}\nwe need to define the corresponding JSON schema to be passed to the tools parameter:\n4.2 Chat Completion\nNow, we invoke the model. It's important to note that we direct the API to use a specific function by setting the tool_choice parameter to {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\" : {\"name\": \"enrich_entities\"}}.\n5. Let's Enrich a Text with Wikipedia links\n5.1 Run OpenAI Task\n5.2 Function Response\n5.3 Token Usage\nTo estimate the inference costs, we can parse the response's \"usage\" field.

Follow these tips to write better documentation.\n\nMake docs easy to skim\n\nFew readers read linearly from top to bottom. They’ll jump around, trying to assess which bit solves their problem, if any. To reduce their search time and increase their odds of success, make docs easy to skim.\n\nSplit content into sections with titles. Section titles act as signposts, telling readers whether to focus in or move on.\n\nPrefer titles with informative sentences over abstract nouns. For example, if you use a title like “Results”, a reader will need to hop into the following text to learn what the results actually are. In contrast, if you use the title “Streaming reduced time to first token by 50%”, it gives the reader the information immediately, without the burden of an extra hop.\n\nInclude a table of contents. Tables of contents help readers find information faster, akin to how hash maps have faster lookups than linked lists. Tables of contents also have a second, oft overlooked benefit: they give readers clues about the doc, which helps them understand if it’s worth reading.\n\nKeep paragraphs short. Shorter paragraphs are easier to skim. If you have an essential point, consider putting it in its own one-sentence paragraph to reduce the odds it’s missed. Long paragraphs can bury information.\n\nBegin paragraphs and sections with short topic sentences that give a standalone preview. When people skim, they look disproportionately at the first word, first line, and first sentence of a section. Write these sentences in a way that don’t depend on prior text. For example, consider the first sentence “Building on top of this, let’s now talk about a faster way.” This sentence will be meaningless to someone who hasn’t read the prior paragraph. Instead, write it in a way that can understood standalone: e.g., “Vector databases can speed up embeddings search.”\n\nPut topic words at the beginning of topic sentences. Readers skim most efficiently when they only need to read a word or two to know what a paragraph is about. Therefore, when writing topic sentences, prefer putting the topic at the beginning of the sentence rather than the end. For example, imagine you’re writing a paragraph on vector databases in the middle of a long article on embeddings search. Instead of writing “Embeddings search can be sped up by vector databases” prefer “Vector databases speed up embeddings search.” The second sentence is better for skimming, because it puts the paragraph topic at the beginning of the paragraph.\n\nPut the takeaways up front. Put the most important information at the tops of documents and sections. Don’t write a Socratic big build up. Don’t introduce your procedure before your results.\n\nUse bullets and tables. Bulleted lists and tables make docs easier to skim. Use them frequently.\n\nBold important text. Don’t be afraid to bold important text to help readers find it.\n\nWrite well\n\nBadly written text is taxing to read. Minimize the tax on readers by writing well.\n\nKeep sentences simple. Split long sentences into two. Cut adverbs. Cut unnecessary words and phrases. Use the imperative mood, if applicable. Do what writing books tell you.\n\nWrite sentences that can be parsed unambiguously. For example, consider the sentence “Title sections with sentences.” When a reader reads the word “Title”, their brain doesn’t yet know whether “Title” is going to be a noun or verb or adjective. It takes a bit of brainpower to keep track as they parse the rest of the sentence, and can cause a hitch if their brain mispredicted the meaning. Prefer sentences that can be parsed more easily (e.g., “Write section titles as sentences”) even if longer. Similarly, avoid noun phrases like “Bicycle clearance exercise notice” which can take extra effort to parse.\n\nAvoid left-branching sentences. Linguistic trees show how words relate to each other in sentences. Left-branching trees require readers to hold more things in memory than right-branching sentences, akin to breadth-first search vs depth-first search. An example of a left-branching sentence is “You need flour, eggs, milk, butter and a dash of salt to make pancakes.” In this sentence you don’t find out what ‘you need’ connects to until you reach the end of the sentence. An easier-to-read right-branching version is “To make pancakes, you need flour, eggs, milk, butter, and a dash of salt.” Watch out for sentences in which the reader must hold onto a word for a while, and see if you can rephrase them.\n\nAvoid demonstrative pronouns (e.g., “this”), especially across sentences. For example, instead of saying “Building on our discussion of the previous topic, now let’s discuss function calling” try “Building on message formatting, now let’s discuss function calling.” The second sentence is easier to understand because it doesn’t burden the reader with recalling the previous topic. Look for opportunities to cut demonstrative pronouns altogether: e.g., “Now let’s discuss function calling.”\n\nBe consistent. Human brains are amazing pattern matchers. Inconsistencies will annoy or distract readers. If we use Title Case everywhere, use Title Case. If we use terminal commas everywhere, use terminal commas. If all of the Cookbook notebooks are named with underscores and sentence case, use underscores and sentence case. Don’t do anything that will cause a reader to go ‘huh, that’s weird.’ Help them focus on the content, not its inconsistencies.\n\nDon’t tell readers what they think or what to do. Avoid sentences like “Now you probably want to understand how to call a function” or “Next, you’ll need to learn to call a function.” Both examples presume a reader’s state of mind, which may annoy them or burn our credibility. Use phrases that avoid presuming the reader’s state. E.g., “To call a function, …”\n\nBe broadly helpful\n\nPeople come to documentation with varying levels of knowledge, language proficiency, and patience. Even if we target experienced developers, we should try to write docs helpful to everyone.\n\nWrite simply. Explain things more simply than you think you need to. Many readers might not speak English as a first language. Many readers might be really confused about technical terminology and have little excess brainpower to spend on parsing English sentences. Write simply. (But don’t oversimplify.)\n\nAvoid abbreviations. Write things out. The cost to experts is low and the benefit to beginners is high. Instead of IF, write instruction following. Instead of RAG, write retrieval-augmented generation (or my preferred term: the search-ask procedure).\n\nOffer solutions to potential problems. Even if 95% of our readers know how to install a Python package or save environment variables, it can still be worth proactively explaining it. Including explanations is not costly to experts—they can skim right past them. But excluding explanations is costly to beginners—they might get stuck or even abandon us. Remember that even an expert JavaScript engineer or C++ engineer might be a beginner at Python. Err on explaining too much, rather than too little.\n\nPrefer terminology that is specific and accurate. Jargon is bad. Optimize the docs for people new to the field, instead of ourselves. For example, instead of writing “prompt”, write “input.” Or instead of writing “context limit” write “max token limit.” The latter terms are more self-evident, and are probably better than the jargon developed in base model days.\n\nKeep code examples general and exportable. In code demonstrations, try to minimize dependencies. Don’t make users install extra libraries. Don’t make them have to refer back and forth between different pages or sections. Try to make examples simple and self-contained.\n\nPrioritize topics by value. Documentation that covers common problems—e.g., how to count tokens—is magnitudes more valuable than documentation that covers rare problems—e.g., how to optimize an emoji database. Prioritize accordingly.\n\nDon’t teach bad habits. If API keys should not be stored in code, never share an example that stores an API key in code.\n\nIntroduce topics with a broad opening. For example, if explaining how to program a good recommender, consider opening by briefly mentioning that recommendations are widespread across the web, from YouTube videos to Amazon items to Wikipedia. Grounding a narrow topic with a broad opening can help people feel more secure before jumping into uncertain territory. And if the text is well-written, those who already know it may still enjoy it.\n\nBreak these rules when you have a good reason\n\nUltimately, do what you think is best. Documentation is an exercise in empathy. Put yourself in the reader’s position, and do what you think will help them the most.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"7e:T11e7,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nMuch of the internet is powered by RESTful APIs. Giving GPT the ability to call them opens up a world of possibilities. This notebook demonstrates how GPTs can be used to intelligently call APIs. It leverages OpenAPI specifications and chained function calls.\n\nThe OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a universally accepted standard for describing the details of RESTful APIs in a format that machines can read and interpret. It enables both humans and computers to understand the capabilities of a service, and it can be leveraged to show GPT how to call APIs.\n\nThis notebook is divided into two main sections:\n\nHow to convert a sample OpenAPI specification into a list of function definitions for the chat completions API.\nHow to use the chat completions API to intelligently invoke these functions based on user instructions.\n\nWe recommend familiariazing yourself with function-calling before proceding.\n\nHow to convert an OpenAPI specification into function definitions\n\nThe example OpenAPI spec we use here was created using gpt-4. We will transform this sample spec into a set of function definitions that can be supplied to the chat completion API. The model, based on the provided user instructions, generates a JSON object containing the necessary arguments to call these functions.\n\nBefore we proceed, let's inspect this generated spec. OpenAPI specs include details about the API's endpoints, the operations they support, the parameters they accept, the requests they can handle, and the responses they return. The spec is defined in JSON format.\n\nThe endpoints in the spec include operations for:\n\nListing all events\nCreating a new event\nRetrieving an event by ID\nDeleting an event by ID\nUpdating an event name by ID\n\nEach operation in the spec has an operationId, which we will use as the function name when we parse the spec into function specifications. The spec also includes schemas that define the data types and structures of the parameters for each operation.\n\nYou can see the schema here:\n\nNow that we have a good understanding of the OpenAPI spec, we can proceed to parse it into function specifications.\n\nWe can write a simple openapi_to_functions function to generate a list of definitions, where each function is represented as a dictionary containing the following keys:\n\nname: This corresponds to the operation identifier of the API endpoint as defined in the OpenAPI specification.\ndescription: This is a brief description or summary of the function, providing an overview of what the function does.\nparameters: This is a schema that defines the expected input parameters for the function. It provides information about the type of each parameter, whether it is required or optional, and other related details.\n\nFor each of the endpoints defined in the schema, we need to do the following:\n\nResolve JSON references: In an OpenAPI specification, it's common to use JSON references (also known as $ref) to avoid duplication. These references point to definitions that are used in multiple places. For example, if multiple API endpoints return the same object structure, that structure can be defined once and then referenced wherever it's needed. We need to resolve and replace these references with the content they point to.\n\nExtract a name for the functions: We will simply use the operationId as the function name. Alternatively, we could use the endpoint path and operation as the function name.\n\nExtract a description and parameters: We will iterate through the description, summary, requestBody and parameters fields to populate the function's description and parameters.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\nHow to call these functions with GPT\n\nNow that we have these function definitions, we can leverage GPT to call them intelligently based on user inputs.\n\nIt's important to note that the chat completions API does not execute the function; instead, it generates the JSON that you can use to call the function in your own code.\n\nFor more information on function-calling, refer to our dedicated function-calling guide.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have demonstrated how to convert OpenAPI specs into function specifications that can be given to GPT for it to intelligently call them, and shown how these can be chained together to perform complex operations.\n\nPossible extensions of this system could include handling more complex user instructions that require conditional logic or looping, integrating with real APIs to perform actual operations, and improving error handling and validation to ensure the instructions are feasible and the function calls are successful."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"7f:T18b3,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"This notebook covers how to fine-tune to increase function calling accuracy and reliability.\\\nYou can find more information on function calling here,\nand on fine tuning here\nFor context, from the function calling notebook above:\ntools is an optional parameter in the Chat Completion API which can be used to provide function specifications. The purpose of this is to enable models to generate function arguments which adhere to the provided specifications. Note that the API will not actually execute any function calls. It is up to developers to execute function calls using model outputs.\nFunction calling is a very powerful tool when it functions as intended. However, we have seen that as the number of \\\nfunctions increases, and the complexity of the task at hand increases, function calling becomes less accurate (e.g.: more hallucinated\ninvocations, and incorrect invocations).\\\nBefore fine tuning for function calling, it's best to begin with:\nImprovements to the function definitions. Make them more clear, and more distinct from one another.\nExperiment with prompt engineering: often a more detailed prompt can help the model call the correct function.\n\nIf the steps above fail to improve function calling to a satisfactory level, then you can try fine tuning for function calling.\nOverview\nThis notebook contains three sections\nAssessing baseline function calling performance:** Evaluating an out-of-the-box gpt-3.5-turbo model on our given function (let's assume that for latency + cost reasons we cannot use gpt-4 for a drone copilot)\nGenerating synthetic data:** Using gpt-4 to create 'golden' set of prompts and function invocations to use as training data\nFine-tuning**: Running the fine tuning job, and evaluating the fine-tuned model\n\nNote: This notebook provides an example of how to create synthetic training data for fine tuning for function calling given just a list of functions. While real-world production test evals are preferable, this method produces strong results and can be used in conjunction with real-world training data.\nGetting baseline function calling performance\nUtilities\nLet's define utility functions for making calls to the Chat Completions API, one to get the completion and one to get the function call.\nBaseline testing\nLet's build an intelligent drone co-pilot. We want to be able to give the co-pilot commands, and have it either call the function\nfor that command, or deny that request if the command is unfeasible.\nWe can first define a system prompt for the copilot.\nNow let's define functions for all of the actions the copilot can take.\nFor starters, let's see how function calling performs with some straight forward feasible prompts, and then one obviously impossible request which call the 'reject_request' function.\nNice! The model performs quite well with these requests. Now let's try some more difficult requests: requests that are almost feasible and are drone-related, but that the drone cannot actually do, and the pilot should reject.\nNow we run into some problems.\nThe model here should reject all of these requests, as they are impossible given the functions, however instead the model calls functions that are somewhat related to the request, but incorrect. The model sets the camera to video when asked to begin 'live streaming to social media', and changes the LED's to blue when asked to 'change the paint color'...\n\nIn this simple case, more prompt engineering may resolve some of these issues, but for the purpose of this example we will demonstrate how fine tuning can be used to improve performance. Additionally, while this case is relatively straightforward, as the number of and complexity of the functions increases, fine tuning becomes more and more impactful.\nGenerating synthetic data\nHelper functions\nWe want to generate every invocation of every function, so that we have\nfull coverage of all potential invocations to create synthetic data for. Then, we will use gpt-4 to come up with prompts that would call each invocation, and we will use that prompt - function invocation pair as training data.\nGenerating every invocation for a function with fixed enums is more simple, but for a function such as\n  control_gimbal we need to set the tilt and pan integer values, so to generate those synthetic invocations we will first set a placeholder, and then later use gpt-4 to come up with reasonable values.\nThe functions below take in all the functions from the function list, and look\nat all the potential invocations of those functions given each function's parameters.\nThe functions also account for required parameters, so that all the invocations\nare actually feasible.\nLet's generate every invocation for every function first\nPrompts:\nIn the below snippet, we generate the invocation of each function except for the rejection_request function.\\\nTo perform effective fine-tuning we need correctly labeled data. We could manually come up with examples and label the data,\\\nor we can generate synthetic data with the help of gpt-4\nEmpirically, gpt-4 needs a bit more help to get good realistic examples of prompts that would generate the reject_request function, so we'll do that next...\nNow that we have all the invocations, let's use gpt-4 to generate prompts that would result in those invocations\nNow let's format the training examples properly. For more documentation on the proper training data formatting for fine tuning for function calling, see here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/fine-tuning-examples\n\nNow, back to the rejection function. Let's generate some prompts that are nearly possible, but should result in the decline_request function being called. To do so, we queried gpt-4 asking for requests that are related to, but not quite possible with, the given list of functions.\nNow combine all the training examples together\nFine tuning\nFinally, we can kick off the fine-tuning job\nEvaluations\nGreat! We trained a fine-tuned model for function calling. Let's see how it does on our evaluation set for prompts that the drone assistant\nshould automatically reject.\nGreat! While the original model only rejected 1 of the 5 requests, the fine tuned model rejected all 5 requests.\nConclusion\nCongratulations! You are now ready to fine tune your model for function calling.

As the current state of the art in text-to-image generation, DALL·E is capable of generating high-quality images across a wide variety of domains. If you're interested in more technical details of how DALL·E-3 was built, you can read more about in our research paper. I'll be going over some of the new features and capabilities of DALL·E-3 in this article, as well as some examples of what new products you can build with the API.\n\nAs a reminder, the Image generation API hasn't changed and maintains the same endpoints and formatting as with DALL·E-2. If you're looking for a guide on how to use the Image API, see the Cookbook article on the subject.\n\nThe only API endpoint available for use with DALL·E-3 right now is Generations (/v1/images/generations). We don’t support variations or inpainting yet, though the Edits and Variations endpoints are available for use with DALL·E-2.\n\nGenerations\n\nThe generation API endpoint creates an image based on a text prompt. There’s a couple new parameters that we've added to enhance what you can create with our models. Here’s a quick overview of the options:\n\nNew parameters:\n\nmodel** (‘dall-e-2’ or ‘dall-e-3’): This is the model you’re generating with. Be careful to set it to ‘dall-e-3’ as it defaults to ‘dall-e-2’ if empty.\nstyle** (‘natural’ or ‘vivid’): The style of the generated images. Must be one of vivid or natural. Vivid causes the model to lean towards generating hyper-real and dramatic images. Natural causes the model to produce more natural, less hyper-real looking images. Defaults to ‘vivid’.\nquality** (‘standard’ or ‘hd’): The quality of the image that will be generated. ‘hd’ creates images with finer details and greater consistency across the image. Defaults to ‘standard’.\n\nOther parameters:\n\nprompt** (str): A text description of the desired image(s). The maximum length is 1000 characters. Required field.\nn** (int): The number of images to generate. Must be between 1 and 10. Defaults to 1. For dall-e-3, only n=1 is supported.\nsize** (...): The size of the generated images. Must be one of 256x256, 512x512, or 1024x1024 for DALL·E-2 models. Must be one of 1024x1024, 1792x1024, or 1024x1792 for DALL·E-3 models.\nresponse_format** ('url' or 'b64_json'): The format in which the generated images are returned. Must be one of \"url\" or \"b64_json\". Defaults to \"url\".\nuser** (str): A unique identifier representing your end-user, which will help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.\n\nNew Features\n\nOur launch of DALL·E-3 comes with lots of new features and capabilities to help you generate the images you want. Here’s a quick overview of what’s new:\n\nPrompt Rewriting\n\nA new feature in the latest DALL·E-3 API is prompt rewriting, where we use GPT-4 to optimize all of your prompts before they’re passed to DALL-E. In our research, we’ve seen that using very detailed prompts give significantly better results. You can read more about our captioning, prompting, and safety mitigations in the DALL·E-3 research paper.\n\nKeep in mind that this feature isn’t able to be disabled at the moment, though you can achieve a high level of fidelity by simply giving instructions to the relabeler in your prompt, as I'll show below with examples.\n\nPrompt Rewriting\n\nStandard vs HD Quality\n\nDALL·E-3 introduces a new 'quality' parameter that allows you to adjust the level of detail and organization in all of your generations. The 'standard' quality generations are the DALL·E-3 you're familiar with, with 'hd' generations bringing a new level of attention to detail and adherence to your prompt. Keep in mind that setting your generation quality to ‘hd’ does increase the cost per image, as well as often increasing the time it takes to generate by ~10 seconds or so.\n\nFor example, here we have two different icons in 'hd' and 'standard' quality. Often the choice between either quality is up to taste, but 'hd' often wins when the task requires more ability to capture details and textures or better composition of a scene.\n\nIcons\n\nHere's another example, this time with a prompt of 'An infinite, uniform grid of tessellated cubes.', which DALL·E conveniently rewrites as \"An infinite, uniform grid of tessellated cubes painted carefully in an isometric perspective. The cubes are meticulously arranged in such a way that they seem to stretch endlessly into the distance. Each cube is identical to the next, with light reflecting consistently across all surfaces, underscoring their uniformity. This is a digitally rendered image.\":\n\nCubes\n\nNew Sizes\n\nDALL·E-3 accepts three different image sizes: 1024px by 1024px, 1792px by 1024px, and 1024px by 1792px. Beyond giving more flexibility in terms of aspect ratio, these sizes can have significant effects on the style and context of your generated image. For example, vertical images might work better when you’re looking for an image that looks like it was taken by a cellphone camera, or horizontal images may work better for landscape paintings or digital designs.\n\nTo demonstrate this difference, here’s multiple variations on the same input prompt with a different aspect ratio. In this case, my prompt was: “Professional photoshoot of a Chemex brewer in the process of brewing coffee.” (For reference, this is a photo of a real Chemex brewer).\n\nHere is the generation in square form (in both HD and standard qualities):\n\nsquare_coffee\n\nYou can see how these images are framed closely to the item and seem to be taken in a more closed space with various surrounding items nearby.\n\nHere are the results on the same prompts with a wider aspect ratio:\n\nwide_coffee\n\nCompared to the previous generations, these come in the form of close-ups. The background is blurred, with greater focus on the item itself, more like professionally organized photoshoots rather than quick snaps.\n\nLastly, we have the vertical aspect ratio:\n\ntall_coffee\n\nThese feel more akin to cellphone images, with a more candid appearance. There’s more action involved: the slowly dripping coffee or the active pour from the pot.\n\nNew Styles\n\nDALL·E-3 introduces two new styles: natural and vivid. The natural style is more similar to the DALL·E-2 style in its 'blander' realism, while the vivid style is a new style that leans towards generating hyper-real and cinematic images. For reference, all DALL·E generations in ChatGPT are generated in the 'vivid' style.\n\nThe natural style is specifically useful in cases where DALL·E-3 over-exaggerates or confuses a subject that's supposed to be more simple, subdued, or realistic. I've often used it for logo generation, stock photos, or other cases where I'm trying to match a real-world object.\n\nHere's an example of the same prompt as above in the vivid style. The vivid is far more cinematic (and looks great), but might pop too much if you're not looking for that.\n\nvivid_coffee\n\nThere's many cases in which I prefer the natural style, such as this example of a painting in the style of Thomas Cole's 'Desolation':\n\nthomas_cole\n\nExamples and Prompts\n\nTo help you get started building with DALL·E-3, I've come up with a few examples of products you could build with the API, as well as collected some styles and capabilities that seem to be unique to DALL·E-3 at the moment. I've also listed some subjects that I'm struggling to prompt DALL·E-3 to generate in case you want to try your hand at it.\n\nIcon Generation\n\nHave you ever struggled to find the perfect icon for your website or app? It would be awesome to see a custom icon generator app that lets you pick the style, size, and subject of your icon, and then generates a custom SVG from the DALL·E generation. Here's some examples of helpful website icons I generated with DALL·E-3:\n\nicon_set\n\nIn this case, I used Potrace to convert the images to SVGs, which you can download here. This is what I used to convert the images:\n\npotrace -s cat.jpg -o cat.svg\n\nYou might need to boost the brightness and contrast of the image before converting it to an SVG. I used the following command to do so:\n\nconvert cat.jpg -brightness-contrast 50x50 cat.jpg\n\nLogo Generation\n\nDALL·E-3 is great at jumpstarting the logo creation process for your company or product. By prompting DALL·E to create 'Vector logo design of a Greek statue, minimalistic, with a white background' I achieved the following:\n\nlogo_greece\n\nHere's another logo I created, this time for an Arabian coffee shop:\n\nlogo_arabia\n\nIn the case of iterating on an existing logo, I took OpenAI's logo, asked GPT-4V to describe it, and then asked DALL·E to generate variations on the logo:\n\niteration\n\nCustom Tattoos\n\nDALL·E-3 is great at generating line art, which might be useful for generating custom tattoos. Here's some line art I generated with DALL·E-3:\n\ntattoos\n\nDie-Cut Stickers \u0026 T-Shirts\n\nWhat if you could generate custom die-cut stickers and t-shirts with DALL·E-3, integrating with a print-on-demand service like Printful or Stickermule? You could have a custom sticker or t-shirt in minutes, with no design experience required. Here's some examples of stickers I generated with DALL·E-3:\n\nstickers\n\nMinecraft Skins\n\nWith some difficulty, I managed to prompt DALL·E-3 to generate Minecraft skins. I'm sure with some clever prompting you could get DALL·E-3 to reliably generate incredible Minecraft skins. It might be hard to use the words 'Minecraft' since DALL·E might think you are trying to generate content from the game itself, instead, you can communicate the idea differently: \"Flat player skin texture of a ninja skin, compatible with Minecraftskins.com or Planet Minecraft.\"\n\nHere's what I managed to create. They might need some work, but I think they're a good start:\n\nminecraft\n\nAnd much more...\n\nHere's some ideas I've had that I haven't had time to try yet:\n\nCustom emojis or Twitch emotes?\nVector illustrations?\nPersonalized Bitmoji-style avatars?\nAlbum art?\nCustom greeting cards?\nPoster/flyer 'pair-programming' with DALL·E?\n\nShowcase\n\nWe're really just starting to figure out what DALL·E-3 is capable of. Here's some of the best styles, generations, and prompts I've seen so far. I've been unable to locate the original authors of some of these images, so if you know who created them, please let me know!\n\ncollage\n\nSources:\n\n@scharan79 on Reddit\n@TalentedJuli on Reddit\n@Wild-Culture-5068 on Reddit\n@popsicle_pope on Reddit\n@gopatrik on Twitter\n@ARTiV3RSE on Twitter\n@willdepue on Twitter\nVarious OpenAI employees\n\nChallenges\n\nDALL·E-3 is still very new and there's still a lot of things it struggles with (or maybe I just haven't figured out how to prompt it correctly yet). Here's some challenges which you might want to try your hand at:\n\nWeb Design\n\nDALL·E really struggles at generating real looking websites, apps, etc. and often generates what looks like a portfolio page of a web designer. Here's the best I've gotten so far:\n\nwebsites\n\nSeamless Textures\n\nIt feels like DALL·E-3 is so close to being able to generate seamless textures. Often they come out great, just slightly cutoff or with a few artifacts. See examples below:\n\nseamless\n\nFonts\n\nUsing DALL·E to generate custom fonts or iterate on letter designs could be really cool, but I haven't been able to get it to work yet. Here's the best I've gotten so far:\n\nfonts\n\nMore Resources\n\nThanks for reading!

To help you keep track of these changes, we expose the system_fingerprint field. If this value is different, you may see different outputs due to changes we've made on our systems. Please note that this feature is in beta and only currently supported for gpt-4-1106-preview and gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.\n\nContext\n\nReproducibility has always been a big request from user communities when using our APIs. For instance, when granted the capability of getting reproducible numerical result, users can unlock quite a bit of use cases that’s sensitive to numerical changes.\n\nModel level features for consistent outputs\n\nThe Chat Completions and Completions APIs are non-deterministic by default (which means model outputs may differ from request to request), but now offer some control towards deterministic outputs using a few model level controls.\n\nThis can unlock consistent completions which enables full control on the model behaviors for anything built on top of the APIs, and quite useful for reproducing results and testing so you know get peace of mind from knowing exactly what you’d get.\n\nImplementing consistent outputs\n\nTo receive mostly deterministic outputs across API calls:\n\nSet the seed parameter to any integer of your choice, but use the same value across requests. For example, 12345.\nSet all other parameters (prompt, temperature, top_p, etc.) to the same values across requests.\nIn the response, check the system_fingerprint field. The system fingerprint is an identifier for the current combination of model weights, infrastructure, and other configuration options used by OpenAI servers to generate the completion. It changes whenever you change request parameters, or OpenAI updates numerical configuration of the infrastructure serving our models (which may happen a few times a year).\n\nIf the seed, request parameters, and system_fingerprint all match across your requests, then model outputs will mostly be identical. There is a small chance that responses differ even when request parameters and system_fingerprint match, due to the inherent non-determinism of our models.\n\nModel level controls for consistent outputs - seed and system_fingerprint\n\nseed\n\nIf specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.\n\nsystem_fingerprint\n\nThis fingerprint represents the backend configuration that the model runs with. It can be used in conjunction with the seed request parameter to understand when backend changes have been made that might impact determinism.This is the indicator on whether users should expect \"almost always the same result\".\n\nExample: Generating a short excerpt with a fixed seed\n\nIn this example, we will demonstrate how to generate a short excerpt using a fixed seed. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to generate consistent results for testing, debugging, or for applications that require consistent outputs.\nPython SDK\nNote\nSwitch to latest version of the SDK (1.3.3 at time of writing).\nFirst, let's try generating few different versions of a short excerpt about \"a journey to Mars\" without the seed parameter. This is the default behavior:\nNow, let's try to tun the same code with a constant seed of 123 and temperature of 0 and compare the responses and system_fingerprint.\nAs we can observe, the seed parameter allows us to generate much more consistent results.\nConclusion\n\nWe demonstrated how to use a fixed integer seed to generate consistent outputs from our model. This is particularly useful in scenarios where reproducibility is important. However, it's important to note that while the seed ensures consistency, it does not guarantee the quality of the output. Note that when you want to use reproducible outputs, you need to set the seed to the same integer across Chat Completions calls. You should also match any other parameters like temperature, max_tokens etc. Further extension of reproducible outputs could be to use consistent seed when benchmarking/evaluating the performance of different prompts or models, to ensure that each version is evaluated under the same conditions, making the comparisons fair and the results reliable."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"83:T28e2,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The new Assistants API is a stateful evolution of our Chat Completions API meant to simplify the creation of assistant-like experiences, and enable developer access to powerful tools like Code Interpreter and Retrieval.\nAssistants API Diagram\nChat Completions API vs Assistants API\n\nThe primitives of the Chat Completions API are Messages, on which you perform a Completion with a Model (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, etc). It is lightweight and powerful, but inherently stateless, which means you have to manage conversation state, tool definitions, retrieval documents, and code execution manually.\n\nThe primitives of the Assistants API are\n\nAssistants, which encapsulate a base model, instructions, tools, and (context) documents,\nThreads, which represent the state of a conversation, and\nRuns, which power the execution of an Assistant on a Thread, including textual responses and multi-step tool use.\n\nWe'll take a look at how these can be used to create powerful, stateful experiences.\n\nSetup\n\nPython SDK\nNote\nWe've updated our Python SDK to add support for the Assistants API, so you'll need to update it to the latest version (1.2.3 at time of writing).\n\nAnd make sure it's up to date by running:\n\nPretty Printing Helper\n\nComplete Example with Assistants API\n\nAssistants\n\nThe easiest way to get started with the Assistants API is through the Assistants Playground.\n\nAssistants Playground\n\nLet's begin by creating an assistant! We'll create a Math Tutor just like in our docs.\n\nCreating New Assistant\n\nYou can view Assistants you've created in the Assistants Dashboard.\n\nAssistants Dashboard\n\nYou can also create Assistants directly through the Assistants API, like so:\n\nRegardless of whether you create your Assistant through the Dashboard or with the API, you'll want to keep track of the Assistant ID. This is how you'll refer to your Assistant throughout Threads and Runs.\n\nNext, we'll create a new Thread and add a Message to it. This will hold the state of our conversation, so we don't have re-send the entire message history each time.\n\nThreads\n\nCreate a new thread:\n\nThen add the Message to the thread:\nNote\nEven though you're no longer sending the entire history each time, you will still be charged for the tokens of the entire conversation history with each Run.\n\nRuns\n\nNotice how the Thread we created is not associated with the Assistant we created earlier! Threads exist independently from Assistants, which may be different from what you'd expect if you've used ChatGPT (where a thread is tied to a model/GPT).\n\nTo get a completion from an Assistant for a given Thread, we must create a Run. Creating a Run will indicate to an Assistant it should look at the messages in the Thread and take action: either by adding a single response, or using tools.\nNote\nRuns are a key difference between the Assistants API and Chat Completions API. While in Chat Completions the model will only ever respond with a single message, in the Assistants API a Run may result in an Assistant using one or multiple tools, and potentially adding multiple messages to the Thread.\n\nTo get our Assistant to respond to the user, let's create the Run. As mentioned earlier, you must specify both the Assistant and the Thread.\n\nUnlike creating a completion in the Chat Completions API, creating a Run is an asynchronous operation. It will return immediately with the Run's metadata, which includes a status that will initially be set to queued. The status will be updated as the Assistant performs operations (like using tools and adding messages).\n\nTo know when the Assistant has completed processing, we can poll the Run in a loop. (Support for streaming is coming soon!) While here we are only checking for a queued or in_progress status, in practice a Run may undergo a variety of status changes which you can choose to surface to the user. (These are called Steps, and will be covered later.)\n\nMessages\n\nNow that the Run has completed, we can list the Messages in the Thread to see what got added by the Assistant.\n\nAs you can see, Messages are ordered in reverse-chronological order – this was done so the most recent results are always on the first page (since results can be paginated). Do keep a look out for this, since this is the opposite order to messages in the Chat Completions API.\n\nLet's ask our Assistant to explain the result a bit further!\n\nThis may feel like a lot of steps to get a response back, especially for this simple example. However, you'll soon see how we can add very powerful functionality to our Assistant without changing much code at all!\n\nExample\n\nLet's take a look at how we could potentially put all of this together. Below is all the code you need to use an Assistant you've created.\n\nSince we've already created our Math Assistant, I've saved its ID in MATH_ASSISTANT_ID. I then defined two functions:\n\nsubmit_message: create a Message on a Thread, then start (and return) a new Run\nget_response: returns the list of Messages in a Thread\n\nI've also defined a create_thread_and_run function that I can re-use (which is actually almost identical to the client.beta.threads.create_and_run compound function in our API ;) ). Finally, we can submit our mock user requests each to a new Thread.\n\nNotice how all of these API calls are asynchronous operations; this means we actually get async behavior in our code without the use of async libraries! (e.g. asyncio)\n\nOnce all Runs are going, we can wait on each and get the responses.\n\nEt voilà!\n\nYou may have noticed that this code is not actually specific to our math Assistant at all... this code will work for any new Assistant you create simply by changing the Assistant ID! That is the power of the Assistants API.\n\nTools\n\nA key feature of the Assistants API is the ability to equip our Assistants with Tools, like Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and custom Functions. Let's take a look at each.\n\nCode Interpreter\n\nLet's equip our Math Tutor with the Code Interpreter tool, which we can do from the Dashboard...\n\nEnabling code interpreter\n\n...or the API, using the Assistant ID.\n\nNow, let's ask the Assistant to use its new tool.\n\nAnd that's it! The Assistant used Code Interpreter in the background, and gave us a final response.\n\nFor some use cases this may be enough – however, if we want more details on what precisely an Assistant is doing we can take a look at a Run's Steps.\n\nSteps\n\nA Run is composed of one or more Steps. Like a Run, each Step has a status that you can query. This is useful for surfacing the progress of a Step to a user (e.g. a spinner while the Assistant is writing code or performing retrieval).\n\nLet's take a look at each Step's step_details.\n\nWe can see the step_details for two Steps:\n\ntool_calls (plural, since it could be more than one in a single Step)\nmessage_creation\n\nThe first Step is a tool_calls, specifically using the code_interpreter which contains:\n\ninput, which was the Python code generated before the tool was called, and\noutput, which was the result of running the Code Interpreter.\n\nThe second Step is a message_creation, which contains the message that was added to the Thread to communicate the results to the user.\n\nRetrieval\n\nAnother powerful tool in the Assistants API is Retrieval: the ability to upload files that the Assistant will use as a knowledge base when answering questions. This can also be enabled from the Dashboard or the API, where we can upload files we want to be used.\n\nEnabling retrieval\nNote\nThere are more intricacies in Retrieval, like Annotations, which may be covered in another cookbook.\n\nFunctions\n\nAs a final powerful tool for your Assistant, you can specify custom Functions (much like the Function Calling in the Chat Completions API). During a Run, the Assistant can then indicate it wants to call one or more functions you specified. You are then responsible for calling the Function, and providing the output back to the Assistant.\n\nLet's take a look at an example by defining a display_quiz() Function for our Math Tutor.\n\nThis function will take a title and an array of questions, display the quiz, and get input from the user for each:\n\ntitle\nquestions\n  question_text\n  question_type: [MULTIPLE_CHOICE, FREE_RESPONSE]\n  choices: [\"choice 1\", \"choice 2\", ...]\n\nUnfortunately I don't know how to get user input within a Python Notebook, so I'll be mocking out responses with get_mock_response.... This is where you'd get the user's actual input.\n\nHere's what a sample quiz would look like:\n\nNow, let's define the interface of this function in JSON format, so our Assistant can call it:\n\nOnce again, let's update our Assistant either through the Dashboard or the API.\n\nEnabling custom function\nNote\nPasting the function JSON into the Dashboard was a bit finicky due to indentation, etc. I just asked ChatGPT to format my function the same as one of the examples on the Dashboard :).\n\nAnd now, we ask for a quiz.\n\nNow, however, when we check the Run's status we see requires_action! Let's take a closer.\n\nThe required_action field indicates a Tool is waiting for us to run it and submit its output back to the Assistant. Specifically, the display_quiz function! Let's start by parsing the name and arguments.\nNote\nWhile in this case we know there is only one Tool call, in practice the Assistant may choose to call multiple tools.\n\nNow let's actually call our display_quiz function with the arguments provided by the Assistant:\n\nGreat! (Remember these responses are the one's we mocked earlier. In reality, we'd be getting input from the back from this function call.)\n\nNow that we have our responses, let's submit them back to the Assistant. We'll need the tool_call ID, found in the tool_call we parsed out earlier. We'll also need to encode our listof responses into a str.\n\nWe can now wait for the Run to complete once again, and check our Thread!\n\nWoohoo 🎉\n\nConclusion\n\nWe covered a lot of ground in this notebook, give yourself a high-five! Hopefully you should now have a strong foundation to build powerful, stateful experiences with tools like Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Functions!\n\nThere's a few sections we didn't cover for the sake of brevity, so here's a few resources to explore further:\n\nAnnotations: parsing file citations\nFiles: Thread scoped vs Assistant scoped\nParallel Function Calls: calling multiple tools in a single Step\nMulti-Assistant Thread Runs: single Thread with Messages from multiple Assistants\nStreaming: coming soon!\n\nNow go off and build something amazing!"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"84:Tfd7,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"This notebook demonstrates how to  build a semantic search application  using OpenAI and MongoDB Atlas vector search\nStep 1: Setup the environment\n\nThere are 2 pre-requisites for this:\n\nMongoDB Atlas cluster: To create a forever free MongoDB Atlas cluster, first, you need to create a MongoDB Atlas account if you don't already have one. Visit the MongoDB Atlas website and click on “Register.” Visit the MongoDB Atlas dashboard and set up your cluster. In order to take advantage of the $vectorSearch operator in an aggregation pipeline, you need to run MongoDB Atlas 6.0.11 or higher. This tutorial can be built using a free cluster. When you’re setting up your deployment, you’ll be prompted to set up a database user and rules for your network connection. Please ensure you save your username and password somewhere safe and have the correct IP address rules in place so your cluster can connect properly. If you need more help getting started, check out our tutorial on MongoDB Atlas.\n\nOpenAI API key   To create your OpenAI key, you'll need to create an account. Once you have that, visit the OpenAI platform. Click on your profile icon in the top right of the screen to get the dropdown menu and select “View API keys”.\n\nNote: After executing the step above you will be prompted to enter the credentials.\nFor this tutorial, we will be using the\nMongoDB sample dataset. Load the sample dataset using the Atlas UI. We'll be using the “sample_mflix” database, which contains a “movies” collection where each document contains fields like title, plot, genres, cast, directors, etc.\n\nStep 2: Setup embeddings generation function\nStep 3: Create and store embeddings\n\nEach document in the sample dataset sample_mflix.movies corresponds to a movie; we will execute an operation to create a vector embedding for the data in the \"plot\" field and store it in the database. Creating vector embeddings using OpenAI embeddings endpoint is necessary for performing a similarity search based on intent.\nAfter executing the above, the documents in \"movies\" collection will contain an additional field of \"embedding\", as defined by the EMBEDDDING_FIELD_NAME variable, apart from already existing fields like title, plot, genres, cast, directors, etc.\nNote: We are restricting this to just 500 documents in the interest of time. If you want to do this over the entire dataset of 23,000+ documents in our sample_mflix database, it will take a little while. Alternatively, you can use the sample_mflix.embedded_movies collection which includes a pre-populated plot_embedding field that contains embeddings created using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small embedding model that you can use with the Atlas Search vector search feature.\n\nStep 4: Create a vector search index\n\nWe will create Atlas Vector Search Index on this collection which will allow us to perform the Approximate KNN search, which powers the semantic search.\nWe will cover 2 ways to create this index - Atlas UI and using MongoDB python driver.\n\n(Optional) Documentation: Create a Vector Search Index\nNow head over to Atlas UI and create an Atlas Vector Search index using the steps descibed here.  The 'dimensions' field with value 1536, corresponds to openAI text-embedding-ada002.\n\nUse the definition given below in the JSON editor on the Atlas UI.\n\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"dynamic\": true,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"embedding\": {\n        \"dimensions\": 1536,\n        \"similarity\": \"dotProduct\",\n        \"type\": \"knnVector\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n(Optional) Alternatively, we can use pymongo driver to create these vector search indexes programatically\nThe python command given in the cell below will create the index (this only works for the most recent version of the Python Driver for MongoDB and MongoDB server version 7.0+ Atlas cluster).\nStep 5: Query your data\n\nThe results for the query here finds movies which have semantically similar plots to the text captured in the query string, rather than being based on the keyword search.\n\n(Optional) Documentation: Run Vector Search Queries"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"85:T1f53,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"In this notebook we will look into building an RAG pipeline and evaluating it with LlamaIndex. It has following 3 sections.\n\nUnderstanding Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nBuilding RAG with LlamaIndex.\nEvaluating RAG with LlamaIndex.\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\nLLMs are trained on vast datasets, but these will not include your specific data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by dynamically incorporating your data during the generation process. This is done not by altering the training data of LLMs, but by allowing the model to access and utilize your data in real-time to provide more tailored and contextually relevant responses.\n\nIn RAG, your data is loaded and and prepared for queries or “indexed”. User queries act on the index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then go to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.\n\nEven if what you’re building is a chatbot or an agent, you’ll want to know RAG techniques for getting data into your application.\nRAG Overview\nStages within RAG\n\nThere are five key stages within RAG, which in turn will be a part of any larger application you build. These are:\n\nLoading: this refers to getting your data from where it lives – whether it’s text files, PDFs, another website, a database, or an API – into your pipeline. LlamaHub provides hundreds of connectors to choose from.\n\nIndexing: this means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n\nStoring: Once your data is indexed, you will want to store your index, along with any other metadata, to avoid the need to re-index it.\n\nQuerying: for any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and LlamaIndex data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries and hybrid strategies.\n\nEvaluation: a critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures of how accurate, faithful and fast your responses to queries are.\nBuild RAG system.\n\nNow that we have understood the significance of RAG system, let's build a simple RAG pipeline.\nSet Your OpenAI API Key\nLet's use Paul Graham Essay text for building RAG pipeline.\nDownload Data\nLoad Data and Build Index.\nBuild a QueryEngine and start querying.\nCheck response.\nBy default it retrieves two similar nodes/ chunks. You can modify that in vector_index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=k).\n\nLet's check the text in each of these retrieved nodes.\nWe have built a RAG pipeline and now need to evaluate its performance. We can assess our RAG system/query engine using LlamaIndex's core evaluation modules. Let's examine how to leverage these tools to quantify the quality of our retrieval-augmented generation system.\nEvaluation\n\nEvaluation should serve as the primary metric for assessing your RAG application. It determines whether the pipeline will produce accurate responses based on the data sources and a range of queries.\n\nWhile it's beneficial to examine individual queries and responses at the start, this approach may become impractical as the volume of edge cases and failures increases. Instead, it may be more effective to establish a suite of summary metrics or automated evaluations. These tools can provide insights into overall system performance and indicate specific areas that may require closer scrutiny.\n\nIn a RAG system, evaluation focuses on two critical aspects:\n\nRetrieval Evaluation:** This assesses the accuracy and relevance of the information retrieved by the system.\nResponse Evaluation:** This measures the quality and appropriateness of the responses generated by the system based on the retrieved information.\nQuestion-Context Pair Generation:\n\nFor the evaluation of a RAG system, it's essential to have queries that can fetch the correct context and subsequently generate an appropriate response. LlamaIndex offers a generate_question_context_pairs module specifically for crafting questions and context pairs which can be used in the assessment of the RAG system of both Retrieval and Response Evaluation. For more details on Question Generation, please refer to the documentation.\nRetrieval Evaluation:\n\nWe are now prepared to conduct our retrieval evaluations. We will execute our RetrieverEvaluator using the evaluation dataset we have generated.\n\nWe first create the Retriever and then define two functions: get_eval_results, which operates our retriever on the dataset, and display_results, which presents the outcomes of the evaluation.\nLet's create the retriever.\nDefine RetrieverEvaluator. We use Hit Rate and MRR metrics to evaluate our Retriever.\n\nHit Rate:\n\nHit rate calculates the fraction of queries where the correct answer is found within the top-k retrieved documents. In simpler terms, it’s about how often our system gets it right within the top few guesses.\n\nMean Reciprocal Rank (MRR):\n\nFor each query, MRR evaluates the system’s accuracy by looking at the rank of the highest-placed relevant document. Specifically, it’s the average of the reciprocals of these ranks across all the queries. So, if the first relevant document is the top result, the reciprocal rank is 1; if it’s second, the reciprocal rank is 1/2, and so on.\n\nLet's check these metrics to check the performance of out retriever.\nLet's define a function to display the Retrieval evaluation results in table format.\nObservation:\n\nThe Retriever with OpenAI Embedding  demonstrates a performance with a hit rate of 0.7586, while the MRR, at 0.6206, suggests there's room for improvement in ensuring the most relevant results appear at the top. The observation that MRR is less than the hit rate indicates that the top-ranking results aren't always the most relevant. Enhancing MRR could involve the use of rerankers, which refine the order of retrieved documents. For a deeper understanding of how rerankers can optimize retrieval metrics, refer to the detailed discussion in our blog post.\nResponse Evaluation:\n\nFaithfulnessEvaluator: Measures if the response from a query engine matches any source nodes which is useful for measuring if the response is hallucinated.\nRelevancy Evaluator: Measures if the response + source nodes match the query.\nFaithfulness Evaluator\nLet's start with FaithfulnessEvaluator.\nWe will use gpt-3.5-turbo for generating response for a given query and gpt-4 for evaluation.\n\nLet's create service_context seperately for gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4.\nCreate a QueryEngine with gpt-3.5-turbo service_context to generate response for the query.\nCreate a  FaithfulnessEvaluator.\n\n\n\nLet's evaluate on one question.\nGenerate response first and use faithfull evaluator.\nRelevancy Evaluator\nRelevancyEvaluator is useful to measure if the response and source nodes (retrieved context) match the query. Useful to see if response actually answers the query.\nInstantiate RelevancyEvaluator for relevancy evaluation with gpt-4\nLet's do relevancy evaluation for one of the query.\nBatch Evaluator:\n\nNow that we have done FaithFulness and Relevancy Evaluation independently.

It's important to note that Langchain adds a pre-processing step, so the embeddings will slightly differ from those generated directly with the OpenAI embeddings API.\nQuerying the database directly\nUsing GraphCypherQAChain, we can generate queries against the database using Natural Language.\nExtracting entities from the prompt\n\nHowever, there is little added value here compared to just writing the Cypher queries ourselves, and it is prone to error.\n\nIndeed, asking an LLM to generate a Cypher query directly might result in the wrong parameters being used, whether it's the entity type or the relationship type, as is the case above.\n\nWe will instead use LLMs to decide what to search for, and then generate the corresponding Cypher queries using templates.\n\nFor this purpose, we will instruct our model to find relevant entities in the user prompt that can be used to query our database.\nGenerating queries\n\nNow that we know what to look for, we can generate the corresponding Cypher queries to query our database.\n\nHowever, the entities extracted might not be an exact match with the data we have, so we will use the GDS cosine similarity function to return products that have relationships with entities similar to what the user is asking.\nFinding similar items\n\nWe can then leverage the graph db to find similar products based on common characteristics.\n\nThis is where the use of a graph db really comes into play.\n\nFor example, we can look for products that are the same category and have another characteristic in common, or find products that have relationships to the same entities.\n\nThis criteria is arbitrary and completely depends on what is the most relevant in relation to your use case.\nFinal result\n\nNow that we have all the pieces working, we will stitch everything together.\n\nWe can also add a fallback option to do a product name/title similarity search if we can't find relevant entities in the user prompt.\n\nWe will explore 2 options, one with a Langchain agent for a conversational experience, and one that is more deterministic based on code only.\n\nDepending on your use case, you might choose one or the other option and tailor it to your needs.\nBuilding a Langchain agent\n\nWe will create a Langchain agent to handle conversations and probing the user for more context.\n\nWe need to define exactly how the agent should behave, and give it access to our query and similarity search tools.\nBuilding a code-only experience\n\nAs our experiments show, using an agent for this type of task might not be the best option.\n\nIndeed, the agent seems to retrieve results from the tools, but comes up with made-up responses.\n\nFor this specific use case, if the conversational aspect is less relevant, we can actually create a function that will call our previously-defined tasks and provide an answer.\nConclusion\n\nUser experience\n\nWhen the primary objective is to extract specific information from our database, Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly enhance our querying capabilities.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to base much of this process on robust code logic to ensure a foolproof user experience.\n\nFor crafting a genuinely conversational chatbot, further exploration in prompt engineering is necessary, possibly incorporating few-shot examples. This approach helps mitigate the risk of generating inaccurate or misleading information and ensures more precise responses.\n\nUltimately, the design choice depends on the desired user experience. For instance, if the aim is to create a visual recommendation system, the importance of a conversational interface is less relevant.\n\nWorking with a knowledge graph\n\nRetrieving content from a knowledge graph adds complexity but can be useful if you want to leverage connections between items.\n\nThe querying part of this notebook would work on a relational database as well, the knowledge graph comes in handy when we want to couple the results with similar items that the graph is surfacing.\n\nConsidering the added complexity, make sure using a knowledge graph is the best option for your use case.\nIf it is the case, feel free to refine what this cookbook presents to match your needs and perform even better!"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"87:T4f6,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nSupabase is an open-source Firebase alternative built on top of Postgres, a production-grade SQL database.\n\nSupabase Vector is a vector toolkit built on pgvector, a Postgres extension that allows you to store your embeddings inside the same database that holds the rest of your application data.

Since Supabase Vector is built on pgvector, you can store your embeddings within the same database that holds the rest of your application data. When combined with pgvector's indexing algorithms, vector search remains fast at large scales.\n\nSupabase adds an ecosystem of services and tools to make app development as quick as possible (such as an auto-generated REST API). We'll use these services to store and query embeddings within Postgres.\n\nThis guide covers:\n\nSetting up your database\nCreating a SQL table that can store vector data\nGenerating OpenAI embeddings using OpenAI's JavaScript client\nStoring the embeddings in your SQL table using the Supabase JavaScript client\nPerforming semantic search over the embeddings using a Postgres function and the Supabase JavaScript client\n\nSetup database\n\nFirst head over to https://database.new to provision your Supabase database. This will create a Postgres database on the Supabase cloud platform. Alternatively, you can follow the local development options if you prefer to run your database locally using Docker.\n\nIn the studio, jump to the SQL editor and execute the following SQL to enable pgvector:\n\n-- Enable the pgvector extension\ncreate extension if not exists vector;\nIn a production application, the best practice is to use database migrations so that all SQL operations are managed within source control. To keep things simple in this guide, we'll execute queries directly in the SQL Editor. If you are building a production app, feel free to move these into a database migration.\n\nCreate a vector table\n\nNext we'll create a table to store documents and embeddings. In the SQL Editor, run:\n\ncreate table documents (\n  id bigint primary key generated always as identity,\n  content text not null,\n  embedding vector (1536) not null\n);\n\nSince Supabase is built on Postgres, we're just using regular SQL here. You can modify this table however you like to better fit your application. If you have existing database tables, you can simply add a new vector column to the appropriate table.\n\nThe important piece to understand is the vector data type, which is a new data type that became available when we enabled the pgvector extension earlier. The size of the vector (1536 here) represents the number of dimensions in the embedding. Since we're using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model in this example, we set the vector size to 1536.\n\nLet's go ahead and create a vector index on this table so that future queries remain performant as the table grows:\n\ncreate index on documents using hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops);\n\nThis index uses the HNSW algorithm to index vectors stored in the embedding column, and specifically when using the inner product operator (``). We'll explain more about this operator later when we implement our match function.\n\nLet's also follow security best practices by enabling row level security on the table:\n\nalter table documents enable row level security;\n\nThis will prevent unauthorized access to this table through the auto-generated REST API (more on this shortly).\n\nGenerate OpenAI embeddings\n\nThis guide uses JavaScript to generate embeddings, but you can easily modify it to use any language supported by OpenAI.\n\nIf you are using JavaScript, feel free to use whichever server-side JavaScript runtime that you prefer (Node.js, Deno, Supabase Edge Functions).\n\nIf you're using Node.js, first install openai as a dependency:\n\nnpm install openai\n\nthen import it:\n\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\n\nIf you're using Deno or Supabase Edge Functions, you can import openai directly from a URL:\n\nimport OpenAI from \"https://esm.sh/openai@4\";\nIn this example we import from https://esm.sh which is a CDN that automatically fetches the respective NPM module for you and serves it over HTTP.\n\nNext we'll generate an OpenAI embedding using text-embedding-3-small:\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst input = \"The cat chases the mouse\";\n\nconst result = await openai.embeddings.create({\n  input,\n  model: \"text-embedding-3-small\",\n});\n\nconst [{ embedding }] = result.data;\n\nRemember that you will need an OpenAI API key to interact with the OpenAI API. You can pass this as an environment variable called OPENAI_API_KEY, or manually set it when you instantiate your OpenAI client:\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: \"\",\n});\n\nRemember:** Never hard-code API keys in your code. Best practice is to either store it in a .env file and load it using a library like dotenv or load it from an external key management system._\n\nStore embeddings in database\n\nSupabase comes with an auto-generated REST API that dynamically builds REST endpoints for each of your tables. This means you don't need to establish a direct Postgres connection to your database - instead you can interact with it simply using by the REST API. This is especially useful in serverless environments that run short-lived processes where re-establishing a database connection every time can be expensive.\n\nSupabase comes with a number of client libraries to simplify interaction with the REST API. In this guide we'll use the JavaScript client library, but feel free to adjust this to your preferred language.\n\nIf you're using Node.js, install @supabase/supabase-js as a dependency:\n\nnpm install @supabase/supabase-js\n\nthen import it:\n\nimport { createClient } from \"@supabase/supabase-js\";\n\nIf you're using Deno or Supabase Edge Functions, you can import @supabase/supabase-js directly from a URL:\n\nimport { createClient } from \"https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2\";\n\nNext we'll instantiate our Supabase client and configure it so that it points to your Supabase project. In this guide we'll store a reference to your Supabase URL and key in a .env file, but feel free to modify this based on how your application handles configuration.\n\nIf you are using Node.js or Deno, add your Supabase URL and service role key to a .env file. If you are using the cloud platform, you can find these from your Supabase dashboard settings page. If you're running Supabase locally, you can find these by running npx supabase status in a terminal.\n\n.env\n\nSUPABASE_URL=\nSUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=\n\nIf you are using Supabase Edge Functions, these environment variables are automatically injected into your function for you so you can skip the above step.\n\nNext we'll pull these environment variables into our app.\n\nIn Node.js, install the dotenv dependency:\n\nnpm install dotenv\n\nAnd retrieve the environment variables from process.env:\n\nimport { config } from \"dotenv\";\n\n// Load .env file\nconfig();\n\nconst supabaseUrl = process.env[\"SUPABASE_URL\"];\nconst supabaseServiceRoleKey = process.env[\"SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\"];\n\nIn Deno, load the .env file using the dotenv standard library:\n\nimport { load } from \"https://deno.land/std@0.208.0/dotenv/mod.ts\";\n\n// Load .env file\nconst env = await load();\n\nconst supabaseUrl = env[\"SUPABASE_URL\"];\nconst supabaseServiceRoleKey = env[\"SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\"];\n\nIn Supabase Edge Functions, simply load the injected environment variables directly:\n\nconst supabaseUrl = Deno.env.get(\"SUPABASE_URL\");\nconst supabaseServiceRoleKey = Deno.env.get(\"SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\");\n\nNext let's instantiate our supabase client:\n\nconst supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceRoleKey, {\n  auth: { persistSession: false },\n});\n\nFrom here we use the supabase client to insert our text and embedding (generated earlier) into the database:\n\nconst { error } = await supabase.from(\"documents\").insert({\n  content: input,\n  embedding,\n});\nIn production, best practice would be to check the response error to see if there were any problems inserting the data and handle it accordingly.\n\nSemantic search\n\nFinally let's perform semantic search over the embeddings in our database. At this point we'll assume your documents table has been filled with multiple records that we can search over.\n\nLet's create a match function in Postgres that performs the semantic search query. Execute the following in the SQL Editor:\n\ncreate function match_documents (\n  query_embedding vector (1536),\n  match_threshold float,\n)\nreturns setof documents\nlanguage plpgsql\nas $$\nbegin\n  return query\n  select *\n  from documents\n  where documents.embedding  query_embedding  query_embedding;\nend;\n$$;\n\nThis function accepts a query_embedding which represents the embedding generated from the search query text (more on this shortly). It also accepts a match_threshold which specifies how similar the document embeddings have to be in order for query_embedding to count as a match.\n\nInside the function we implement the query which does two things:\n\nFilters the documents to only include those who's embeddings match within the above match_threshold. Since the ` operator performs the negative inner product (versus positive inner product), we negate the similarity threshold before comparing. This means a match_threshold` of 1 is most similar, and -1 is most dissimilar.\nOrders the documents by negative inner product (``) ascending. This allows us to retrieve documents that match closest first.\nSince OpenAI embeddings are normalized, we opted to use inner product (`) because it is slightly more performant than other operators like cosine distance (`). It is important to note though this only works because the embeddings are normalized - if they weren't, cosine distance should be used.\n\nNow we can call this function from our application using the supabase.rpc() method:\n\nconst query = \"What does the cat chase?\";\n\n// First create an embedding on the query itself\nconst result = await openai.embeddings.create({\n  input: query,\n  model: \"text-embedding-3-small\",\n});\n\nconst [{ embedding }] = result.data;\n\n// Then use this embedding to search for matches\nconst { data: documents, error: matchError } = await supabase\n  .rpc(\"match_documents\", {\n    query_embedding: embedding,\n    match_threshold: 0.8,\n  })\n  .select(\"content\")\n  .limit(5);\n\nIn this example, we set a match threshold to 0.8. Adjust this threshold based on what works best with your data.\n\nNote that since match_documents returns a set of documents, we can treat this rpc() like a regular table query. Specifically this means we can chain additional commands to this query, like select() and limit(). Here we select just the columns we care about from the documents table (content), and we limit the number of documents returned (max 5 in this example).\n\nAt this point you have a list of documents that matched the query based on semantic relationship, ordered by most similar first.\n\nNext steps\n\nYou can use this example as the foundation for other semantic search techniques, like retrieval augmented generation (RAG).\n\nFor more information on OpenAI embeddings, read the Embedding docs.\n\nFor more information on Supabase Vector, read the AI \u0026 Vector docs.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"89:T22ff,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nIn this notebook we share examples of how to implement guardrails for your LLM applications. A guardrail is a generic term for detective controls that aim to steer your application. Greater steerability is a common requirement given the inherent randomness of LLMs, and so creating effective guardrails has become one of the most common areas of performance optimization when pushing an LLM from prototype to production.\n\nGuardrails are incredibly diverse and can be deployed to virtually any context you can imagine something going wrong with LLMs. This notebook aims to give simple examples that can be extended to meet your unique use case, as well as outlining the trade-offs to consider when deciding whether to implement a guardrail, and how to do it.\n\nThis notebook will focus on:\nInput guardrails that flag inappropriate content before it gets to your LLM\nOutput guardrails that validate what your LLM has produced before it gets to the customer\n\nNote: This notebook tackles guardrails as a generic term for detective controls around an LLM - for the official libraries that provide distributions of pre-built guardrails frameworks, please check out the following:\nNeMo Guardrails\nGuardrails AI\n\n1. Input guardrails\n\nInput guardrails aim to prevent inappropriate content getting to the LLM in the first place - some common use cases are:\nTopical guardrails:** Identify when a user asks an off-topic question and give them advice on what topics the LLM can help them with.\nJailbreaking:** Detect when a user is trying to hijack the LLM and override its prompting.\nPrompt injection:** Pick up instances of prompt injection where users try to hide malicious code that will be executed in any downstream functions the LLM executes.\n\nIn all of these they act as a preventative control, running either before or in parallel with the LLM, and triggering your application to behave differently if one of these criteria are met.\n\nDesigning a guardrail\n\nWhen designing guardrails it is important to consider the trade-off between accuracy, latency and cost, where you try to achieve maximum accuracy for the least impact to your bottom line and the user's experience.\n\nWe'll begin with a simple topical guardrail which aims to detect off-topic questions and prevent the LLM from answering if triggered. This guardrail consists of a simple prompt and uses gpt-3.5-turbo, maximising latency/cost over accuracy, but if we wanted to optimize further we could consider:\nAccuracy:** You could consider using a fine-tuned model or few-shot examples to increase the accuracy. RAG can also be effective if you have a corpus of information that can help determine whether a piece of content is allowed or not.\nLatency/Cost:** You could try fine-tuning smaller models, such as babbage-002 or open-source offerings like Llama, which can perform quite well when given enough training examples. When using open-source offerings you can also tune the machines you are using for inference to maximize either cost or latency reduction.\n\nThis simple guardrail aims to ensure the LLM only answers to a predefined set of topics, and responds to out-of-bounds queries with a canned message.\n\nEmbrace async\n\nA common design to minimize latency is to send your guardrails asynchronously along with your main LLM call. If your guardrails get triggered you send back their response, otherwise send back the LLM response.\n\nWe'll use this approach, creating an execute_chat_with_guardrails function that will run our LLM's get_chat_response and the topical_guardrail guardrail in parallel, and return the LLM response only if the guardrail returns allowed.\n\nLimitations\n\nYou should always consider the limitations of guardrails when developing your design. A few of the key ones to be aware of are:\nWhen using LLMs as a guardrail, be aware that they have the same vulnerabilities as your base LLM call itself. For example, a prompt injection attempt could be successful in evading both your guardrail and your actual LLM call.\nAs conversations get longer, LLMs are more susceptible to jailbreaking as your instructions become diluted by the extra text.\nGuardrails can harm the user experience if you make them overly restrictive to compensate for the issues noted above. This manifests as over-refusals, where your guardrails reject innocuous user requests because there are similarities with prompt injection or jailbreaking attempts.\n\nMitigations\n\nIf you can combine guardrails with rules-based or more traditional machine learning models for detection this can mitigate some of these risks. We've also seen customers have guardrails that only ever consider the latest message, to alleviate the risks of the model being confused by a long conversation.\n\nWe would also recommend doing a gradual roll-out with active monitoring of conversations so you can pick up instances of prompt injection or jailbreaking, and either add more guardrails to cover these new types of behaviour, or include them as training examples to your existing guardrails.\nLooks like our guardrail worked - the first question was allowed through, but the second was blocked for being off-topic. Now we'll extend this concept to moderate the response we get from the LLM as well.\n2. Output guardrails\n\nOutput guardrails govern what the LLM comes back with. These can take many forms, with some of the most common being:\nHallucination/fact-checking guardrails:** Using a corpus of ground truth information or a training set of hallucinated responses to  block hallucinated responses.\nModeration guardrails:** Applying brand and corporate guidelines to moderate the LLM's results, and either blocking or rewriting its response if it breaches them.\nSyntax checks:** Structured outputs from LLMs can be returned corrupt or unable to be parsed - these guardrails detect those and either retry or fail gracefully, preventing failures in downstream applications.\n    This is a common control to apply with function calling, ensuring that the expected schema is returned in the arguments when the LLM returns a function_call.\n\nModeration guardrail\n\nHere we implement a moderation guardrail that uses a version of the G-Eval evaluation method to score the presence of unwanted content in the LLM's response. This method is demonstrated in more detail in of our other notebooks.\n\nTo accomplish this we will make an extensible framework for moderating content that takes in a domain and applies criteria to a piece of content using a set of steps:\nWe set a domain name, which describes the type of content we're going to moderate.\nWe provide criteria, which outline clearly what the content should and should not contain.\nStep-by-step instructions are provided for the LLM to grade the content.\nThe LLM returns a discrete score from 1-5.\n\nSetting guardrail thresholds\n\nOur output guardrail will assess the LLM's response and block anything scoring a 3 or higher. Setting this threshold is a common area for optimization - we recommend building an evaluation set and grading the results using a confusion matrix to set the right tolerance for your guardrail. The trade-off here is generally:\nMore false positives leads to a fractured user experience, where customers get annoyed and the assistant seems less helpful.\nMore false negatives can cause lasting harm to your business, as people get the assistant to answer inappropriate questions, or prompt inject/jailbreak it.\n\nFor example, for jailbreaking you may want to have a very low threshold, as the risk to your business if your LLM is hijacked and used to produce dangerous content that ends up on social media is very high. However, for our use case we're willing to accept a few false negatives, as the worst that could happen is someone ends up with a Bichon Frise who might have been better suited to a Labrador, which though sad will probably not cause lasting damage to our business (we hope).\nConclusion\n\nGuardrails are a vibrant and evolving topic in LLMs, and we hope this notebook has given you an effective introduction to the core concepts around guardrails. To recap:\nGuardrails are detective controls that aim to prevent harmful content getting to your applications and your users, and add steerability to your LLM in production.\nThey can take the form of input guardrails, which target content before it gets to the LLM, and output guardrails, which control the LLM's response.\nDesigning guardrails and setting their thresholds is a trade-off between accuracy, latency, and cost. Your decision should be based on clear evaluations of the performance of your guardrails, and an understanding of what the cost of a false negative and false positive are for your business.\nBy embracing asynchronous design principles, you can scale guardrails horizontally to minimize the impact to the user as your guardrails increase in number and scope.\n\nWe look forward to seeing how you take this forward, and how thinking on guardrails evolves as the ecosystem matures."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"8a:T3184,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nWelcome to the Clothing Matchmaker App Jupyter Notebook! This project demonstrates the power of the GPT-4o model in analyzing images of clothing items and extracting key features such as color, style, and type. The core of our app relies on this advanced image analysis model developed by OpenAI, which enables us to accurately identify the characteristics of the input clothing item.\n\nGPT-4o is a model that combines natural language processing with image recognition, allowing it to understand and generate responses based on both text and visual inputs.\n\nBuilding on the capabilities of the GPT-4o model, we employ a custom matching algorithm and the RAG technique to search our knowledge base for items that complement the identified features. This algorithm takes into account factors like color compatibility and style coherence to provide users with suitable recommendations. Through this notebook, we aim to showcase the practical application of these technologies in creating a clothing recommendation system.\n\nUsing the combination of GPT-4o + RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) offers several advantages:\n\nContextual Understanding: GPT-4o can analyze input images and understand the context, such as the objects, scenes, and activities depicted. This allows for more accurate and relevant suggestions or information across various domains, whether it's interior design, cooking, or education.\nRich Knowledge Base: RAG combines the generative capabilities of GPT-4 with a retrieval component that accesses a large corpus of information across different fields. This means the system can provide suggestions or insights based on a wide range of knowledge, from historical facts to scientific concepts.\nCustomization: The approach allows for easy customization to cater to specific user needs or preferences in various applications. Whether it's tailoring suggestions to a user's taste in art or providing educational content based on a student's learning level, the system can be adapted to deliver personalized experiences.\n\nOverall, the GPT-4o + RAG approach offers a powerful and flexible solution for various fashion-related applications, leveraging the strengths of both generative and retrieval-based AI techniques.\nEnvironment Setup\nFirst we will install the necessary dependencies, then import the libraries and write some utility functions that we will use later on.\nCreating the Embeddings\nWe will now set up the knowledge base by choosing a database and generating embeddings for it. I am using the sample_styles.csv file for this in the data folder. This is a sample of a bigger dataset that contains ~44K items. This step can also be replaced by using an out-of-the-box vector database. For example, you can follow one of these cookbooks to set up your vector database.\nNow we will generate embeddings for the entire dataset. We can parallelize the execution of these embeddings to ensure that the script scales up for larger datasets. With this logic, the time to create embeddings for the full 44K entry dataset decreases from 4h to 2-3min.\nTwo options for creating the embeddings:\nThe next line will create the embeddings for the sample clothes dataset. This will take around 0.02s to process and another ~30s to write the results to a local .csv file. The process is using our text_embedding_3_large model which is priced at $0.00013/1K tokens. Given that the dataset has around 1K entries, the following operation will cost approximately $0.001. If you decide to work with the entire dataset of 44K entries, this operation will take 2-3min to process and it will cost approximately $0.07.\n\nIf you would not like to proceed with creating your own embeddings, we will use a dataset of pre-computed embeddings. You can skip this cell and uncomment the code in the following cell to proceed with loading the pre-computed vectors. This operation takes ~1min to load all the data in memory.\nBuilding the Matching Algorithm\n\nIn this section, we'll develop a cosine similarity retrieval algorithm to find similar items in our dataframe. We'll utilize our custom cosine similarity function for this purpose. While the sklearn library offers a built-in cosine similarity function, recent updates to its SDK have led to compatibility issues, prompting us to implement our own standard cosine similarity calculation.\n\nIf you already have a vector database set up, you can skip this step. Most standard databases come with their own search functions, which simplify the subsequent steps outlined in this guide. However, we aim to demonstrate that the matching algorithm can be tailored to meet specific requirements, such as a particular threshold or a specified number of matches returned.\n\nThe find_similar_items function accepts four parameters:\nembedding: The embedding for which we want to find a match.\nembeddings: A list of embeddings to search through for the best matches.\nthreshold (optional): This parameter specifies the minimum similarity score for a match to be considered valid. A higher threshold results in closer (better) matches, while a lower threshold allows for more items to be returned, though they may not be as closely matched to the initial embedding.\ntop_k (optional): This parameter determines the number of items to return that exceed the given threshold. These will be the top-scoring matches for the provided embedding.\nAnalysis Module\n\nIn this module, we leverage gpt-4o to analyze input images and extract important features like detailed descriptions, styles, and types. The analysis is performed through a straightforward API call, where we provide the URL of the image for analysis and request the model to identify relevant features.\n\nTo ensure the model returns accurate results, we use specific techniques in our prompt:\n\nOutput Format Specification: We instruct the model to return a JSON block with a predefined structure, consisting of:\n   items (str[]): A list of strings, each representing a concise title for an item of clothing, including style, color, and gender. These titles closely resemble the productDisplayName property in our original database.\n   category (str): The category that best represents the given item. The model selects from a list of all unique articleTypes present in the original styles dataframe.\n   gender (str): A label indicating the gender the item is intended for. The model chooses from the options [Men, Women, Boys, Girls, Unisex].\n\nClear and Concise Instructions:\n   We provide clear instructions on what the item titles should include and what the output format should be. The output should be in JSON format, but without the json tag that the model response normally contains.\n\nOne Shot Example:\n   To further clarify the expected output, we provide the model with an example input description and a corresponding example output. Although this may increase the number of tokens used (and thus the cost of the call), it helps to guide the model and results in better overall performance.\n\nBy following this structured approach, we aim to obtain precise and useful information from the gpt-4o model for further analysis and integration into our database.\nTesting the Prompt with Sample Images\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our prompt, let's load and test it with a selection of images from our dataset. We'll use images from the \"data/sample_clothes/sample_images\" folder, ensuring a variety of styles, genders, and types. Here are the chosen samples:\n\n2133.jpg: Men's shirt\n7143.jpg: Women's shirt\n4226.jpg: Casual men's printed t-shirt\n\nBy testing the prompt with these diverse images, we can assess its ability to accurately analyze and extract relevant features from different types of clothing items and accessories.\nWe need a utility function to encode the .jpg images in base64\nNext, we process the output from the image analysis and use it to filter and display matching items from our dataset. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\nExtracting Image Analysis Results: We extract the item descriptions, category, and gender from the image_analysis dictionary.\n\nFiltering the Dataset: We filter the styles_df DataFrame to include only items that match the gender from the image analysis (or are unisex) and exclude items of the same category as the analyzed image.\n\nFinding Matching Items: We use the find_matching_items_with_rag function to find items in the filtered dataset that match the descriptions extracted from the analyzed image.\n\nDisplaying Matching Items: We create an HTML string to display images of the matching items. We construct the image paths using the item IDs and append each image to the HTML string. Finally, we use display(HTML(html)) to render the images in the notebook.\n\nThis cell effectively demonstrates how to use the results of image analysis to filter a dataset and visually display items that match the analyzed image's characteristics.\nGuardrails\n\nIn the context of using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o, \"guardrails\" refer to mechanisms or checks put in place to ensure that the model's output remains within desired parameters or boundaries. These guardrails are crucial for maintaining the quality and relevance of the model's responses, especially when dealing with complex or nuanced tasks.\n\nGuardrails are useful for several reasons:\n\nAccuracy: They help ensure that the model's output is accurate and relevant to the input provided.\nConsistency: They maintain consistency in the model's responses, especially when dealing with similar or related inputs.\nSafety: They prevent the model from generating harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content.\nContextual Relevance: They ensure that the model's output is contextually relevant to the specific task or domain it is being used for.\n\nIn our case, we are using GPT-4o to analyze fashion images and suggest items that would complement an original outfit. To implement guardrails, we can refine results: After obtaining initial suggestions from GPT-4o, we can send the original image and the suggested items back to the model. We can then ask GPT-4o to evaluate whether each suggested item would indeed be a good fit for the original outfit.\n\nThis gives the model the ability to self-correct and adjust its own output based on feedback or additional information. By implementing these guardrails and enabling self-correction, we can enhance the reliability and usefulness of the model's output in the context of fashion analysis and recommendation.\n\nTo facilitate this, we write a prompt that asks the LLM for a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to the question of whether the suggested items match the original outfit or not. This binary response helps streamline the refinement process and ensures clear and actionable feedback from the model.\nFinally, let's determine which of the items identified above truly complement the outfit.\nWe can observe that the initial list of potential items has been further refined, resulting in a more curated selection that aligns well with the outfit. Additionally, the model provides explanations for why each item is considered a good match, offering valuable insights into the decision-making process.\nConclusion\n\nIn this Jupyter Notebook, we explored the application of GPT-4o and other machine learning techniques to the domain of fashion. We demonstrated how to analyze images of clothing items, extract relevant features, and use this information to find matching items that complement an original outfit. Through the implementation of guardrails and self-correction mechanisms, we refined the model's suggestions to ensure they are accurate and contextually relevant.\n\nThis approach has several practical uses in the real world, including:\n\nPersonalized Shopping Assistants: Retailers can use this technology to offer personalized outfit recommendations to customers, enhancing the shopping experience and increasing customer satisfaction.\nVirtual Wardrobe Applications: Users can upload images of their own clothing items to create a virtual wardrobe and receive suggestions for new items that match their existing pieces.\nFashion Design and Styling: Fashion designers and stylists can use this tool to experiment with different combinations and styles, streamlining the creative process.\n\nHowever, one of the considerations to keep in mind is cost. The use of LLMs and image analysis models can incur costs, especially if used extensively. It's important to consider the cost-effectiveness of implementing these technologies.\n\nOverall, this notebook serves as a foundation for further exploration and development in the intersection of fashion and AI, opening doors to more personalized and intelligent fashion recommendation systems."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"8b:Tdc1,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThis notebook shows how to leverage GPT-4V to turn rich PDF documents such as slide decks or exports from web pages into usable content for your RAG application.\n\nThis technique can be used if you have a lot of unstructured data containing valuable information that you want to be able to retrieve as part of your RAG pipeline.\n\nFor example, you could build a Knowledge Assistant that could answer user queries about your company or product based on information contained in PDF documents.\n\nThe example documents used in this notebook are located at data/example_pdfs.

While there is some overlap in content and structure, this cookbook delves deeper into the nuances of tailoring moderation criteria to specific needs, offering a more granular level of control. If you're interested in a broader overview of content safety measures, including guardrails and moderation, we recommend starting with the Guardrails Cookbook. Together, these resources offer a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively manage and moderate content within your applications.\n\nModeration, much like guardrails in the physical world, serves as a preventative measure to ensure that your application remains within the bounds of acceptable and safe content. Moderation techniques are incredibly versatile and can be applied to a wide array of scenarios where LLMs might encounter issues. This notebook is designed to offer straightforward examples that can be adapted to suit your specific needs, while also discussing the considerations and trade-offs involved in deciding whether to implement moderation and how to go about it. This notebook will use our Moderation API, a tool you can use to check whether text is potentially harmful.\n\nThis notebook will concentrate on:\n\nInput Moderation:** Identifying and flagging inappropriate or harmful content before it is processed by your LLM.\nOutput Moderation:** Reviewing and validating the content generated by your LLM before it reaches the end user.\nCustom Moderation:** Tailoring moderation criteria and rules to suit the specific needs and context of your application, ensuring a personalized and effective content control mechanism.\n1. Input moderation\nInput Moderation focuses on preventing harmful or inappropriate content from reaching the LLM, with common applications including:\nContent Filtering:** Prevent the spread of harmful content such as hate speech, harassment, explicit material, and misinformation on social media, forums, and content creation platforms.\nCommunity Standards Enforcement:** Ensure that user interactions, such as comments, forum posts, and chat messages, adhere to the community guidelines and standards of online platforms, including educational environments, gaming communities, or dating apps.\nSpam and Fraud Prevention:** Filter out spam, fraudulent content, and misleading information in online forums, comment sections, e-commerce platforms, and customer reviews.\n\nThese measures act as preventive controls, operating before or alongside the LLM to alter your application's behavior if specific criteria are met.\nEmbrace async\nA common design to minimize latency is to send your moderations asynchronously along with your main LLM call. If your moderation gets triggered you send back a placeholder response, otherwise send back the LLM response. This pattern can also be found in our Guardrails Cookbook. It's important to note that while the async mode is effective in minimizing latency, it can also lead to unnecessary costs. Specifically, you could avoid completion costs if the content is flagged before processing. Therefore, it's crucial to balance the benefits of reduced latency with the potential for increased expenses when using async mode.\n\nWe'll use this approach, creating an execute_chat_with_moderation function that will run our LLM's get_chat_response and the check_expression moderation function in parallel, and return the LLM response only if the moderation returns False (not triggered).\n\nWorkflow:\nWe will create a workflow that incorporates the Moderation API to check user input for any potentially unsafe content before it is sent to the Language Model (LLM). This ensures that only appropriate content is processed further in the application.\n\nReceive an input from the user\nUse the Moderation API to analyze the input for any problematic content.\nConditional Processing:\nIf the input is flagged by the moderation check, handle it accordingly (e.g., reject the input, ask the user to rephrase, etc.).\nIf the input is not flagged, pass it to the LLM for further processing.\n\nWe will demonstrate this workflow with two example prompts.\nLooks like our moderation worked - the first question was allowed through, but the second was blocked for inapropriate content. Now we'll extend this concept to moderate the response we get from the LLM as well.\n2. Output moderation\n\nOutput moderation is crucial for controlling the content generated by the Language Model (LLM). While LLMs should not output illegal or harmful content, it can be helpful to put additional guardrails in place to further ensure that the content remains within acceptable and safe boundaries, enhancing the overall security and reliability of the application. Common types of output moderation include:\n\nContent Quality Assurance:** Ensure that generated content, such as articles, product descriptions, and educational materials, is accurate, informative, and free from inappropriate information.\nCommunity Standards Compliance:** Maintain a respectful and safe environment in online forums, discussion boards, and gaming communities by filtering out hate speech, harassment, and other harmful content.\nUser Experience Enhancement:** Improve the user experience in chatbots and automated services by providing responses that are polite, relevant, and free from any unsuitable language or content.\n\nIn all these scenarios, output moderation plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality and integrity of the content generated by language models, ensuring that it meets the standards and expectations of the platform and its users.\nSetting moderation thresholds\nOpenAI has selected thresholds for moderation categories that balance precision and recall for our use cases, but your use case or tolerance for moderation may be different. Setting this threshold is a common area for optimization - we recommend building an evaluation set and grading the results using a confusion matrix to set the right tolerance for your moderation. The trade-off here is generally:\n\nMore false positives leads to a fractured user experience, where customers get annoyed and the assistant seems less helpful.\nMore false negatives can cause lasting harm to your business, as people get the assistant to answer inappropriate questions, or provide inappropriate responses.\n\nFor example, on a platform dedicated to creative writing, the moderation threshold for certain sensitive topics might be set higher to allow for greater creative freedom while still providing a safety net to catch content that is clearly beyond the bounds of acceptable expression. The trade-off is that some content that might be considered inappropriate in other contexts is allowed, but this is deemed acceptable given the platform's purpose and audience expectations.\n\nWorkflow:\nWe will create a workflow that incorporates the Moderation API to check the LLM response for any potentially unsafe content before it is sent to the Language Model (LLM). This ensures that only appropriate content is displayed to the user.\n\nReceive an input from the user\nSend prompt to LLM and generate a response\nUse the Moderation API to analyze the LLM's response for any problematic content.\nConditional Processing:\nIf the response is flagged by the moderation check, handle it accordingly (e.g., reject the response, show a placeholder message, etc.).\nIf the response is not flagged, display it to the user.\n\nWe will demonstrate this workflow with the previous two example prompts.\nAs observed, the first two examples behaved as expected. However, the \"interesting example\" did not perform as anticipated. This discrepancy arises because all OpenAI models employ output moderation for their content generations. Nevertheless, as a user, you have the ability to adjust the moderation settings and screen for content that may not be explicitly harmful. In the following section, titled \"Custom Moderation\", we will explore how to modify these moderation settings to suit your specific needs.\n3. Custom moderation\n\nNote: This section does not use the Moderation API.\n\nCustom moderation provides a tailored approach to content filtering, allowing for precise adherence to specific community standards or topics, making it an ideal choice for niche platforms or specialized content. Unlike the general categories covered by the moderation API, custom moderation offers a higher degree of control and requires more effort to set up and maintain. It shares the common goal of ensuring content safety with guardrails, focusing on setting criteria to filter and manage content, whether it's user input or output from language models. Custom moderation can be an alternative or an extension to the moderation API, that uses our completions endpoint. For those interested in exploring guardrails further, a cookbook with examples and guidance is available here.\n\nWorkflow\nWe will implement a small example to showcase custom moderation. We will use an extra call to gpt-4 to assess messages and decide if they should be moderated or not.\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this notebook has explored the essential role of moderation in applications powered by language models (LLMs). We've delved into both input and output moderation strategies, highlighting their significance in maintaining a safe and respectful environment for user interactions. Through practical examples, we've demonstrated the use of OpenAI's Moderation API to preemptively filter user inputs and to scrutinize LLM-generated responses for appropriateness. The implementation of these moderation techniques is crucial for upholding the integrity of your application and ensuring a positive experience for your users.\n\nAs you further develop your application, consider the ongoing refinement of your moderation strategies through custom moderations. This may involve tailoring moderation criteria to your specific use case or integrating a combination of machine learning models and rule-based systems for a more nuanced analysis of content. Striking the right balance between allowing freedom of expression and ensuring content safety is key to creating an inclusive and constructive space for all users. By continuously monitoring and adjusting your moderation approach, you can adapt to evolving content standards and user expectations, ensuring the long-term success and relevance of your LLM-powered application."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"8e:T928,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The objective of this notebook is to demonstrate how to summarize large documents with a controllable level of detail.\n\nIf you give a GPT model the task of summarizing a long document (e.g. 10k or more tokens), you'll tend to get back a relatively short summary that isn't proportional to the length of the document. For instance, a summary of a 20k token document will not be twice as long as a summary of a 10k token document. One way we can fix this is to split our document up into pieces, and produce a summary piecewise. After many queries to a GPT model, the full summary can be reconstructed. By controlling the number of text chunks and their sizes, we can ultimately control the level of detail in the output.\nWe'll define a simple utility to wrap calls to the OpenAI API.\nNext we'll define some utilities to chunk a large document into smaller pieces.\nNow we can define a utility to summarize text with a controllable level of detail (note the detail parameter).\n\nThe function first determines the number of chunks by interpolating between a minimum and a maximum chunk count based on a controllable detail parameter. It then splits the text into chunks and summarizes each chunk.\nNow we can use this utility to produce summaries with varying levels of detail. By increasing detail from 0 to 1 we get progressively longer summaries of the underlying document. A higher value for the detail parameter results in a more detailed summary because the utility first splits the document into a greater number of chunks. Each chunk is then summarized, and the final summary is a concatenation of all the chunk summaries.\nThe original document is nearly 15k tokens long. Notice how large the gap is between the length of summary_with_detail_0 and summary_with_detail_1. It's nearly 25 times longer!\nLet's inspect the summaries to see how the level of detail changes when the detail parameter is increased from 0 to 1.\nNote that this utility also allows passing additional instructions.\nFinally, note that the utility allows for recursive summarization, where each summary is based on the previous summaries, adding more context to the summarization process. This can be enabled by setting the summarize_recursively parameter to True. This is more computationally expensive, but can increase consistency and coherence of the combined summary."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"8f:T1079,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThe new GPT-4 Turbo model, available as gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09 as of April 2024, now enables function calling with vision capabilities, better reasoning and a knowledge cutoff date of Dec 2023. Using images with function calling will unlock multimodal use cases and the ability to use reasoning, allowing you to go beyond OCR and image descriptions.\n\nWe will go through two examples to demonstrate the use of function calling with GPT-4 Turbo with Vision:\n\nSimulating a customer service assistant for delivery exception support\nAnalyzing an organizational chart to extract employee information\nInstallation and Setup\n1. Simulating a customer service assistant for delivery exception support\nWe will simulate a customer service assistant for a delivery service that is equipped to analyze images of packages. The assistant will perform the following actions based on the image analysis:\nIf a package appears damaged in the image, automatically process a refund according to policy.\nIf the package looks wet, initiate a replacement.\nIf the package appears normal and not damaged, escalate to an agent.\nLet's look at the sample images of packages that the customer service assistant will analyze to determine the appropriate action. We will encode the images as base64 strings for processing by the model.\nWe have successfully encoded the sample images as base64 strings and displayed them. The customer service assistant will analyze these images to determine the appropriate action based on the package condition.\n\nLet's now define the functions/tools for order processing, such as escalating an order to an agent, refunding an order, and replacing an order. We will create placeholder functions to simulate the processing of these actions based on the identified tools. We will be using Pydantic models to define the structure of the data for order actions.\n\nSimulating user messages and processing the package images\n\nWe will simulate user messages containing the package images and process the images using the GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model. The model will identify the appropriate tool call based on the image analysis and the predefined actions for damaged, wet, or normal packages. We will then process the identified action based on the order ID and display the results.\n2.  Analyzing an organizational chart to extract employee information\n\nFor the second example, we will analyze an organizational chart image to extract employee information, such as employee names, roles, managers, and manager roles. We will use GPT-4 Turbo with Vision to process the organizational chart image and extract structured data about the employees in the organization. Indeed, function calling lets us go beyond OCR to actually deduce and translate hierarchical relationships within the chart.\n\nWe will start with a sample organizational chart in PDF format that we want to analyze and convert the first page of the PDF to a JPEG image for analysis.\nThe organizational chart image has been successfully extracted from the PDF file and displayed. Let's now define a function to analyze the organizational chart image using the new GPT4 Turbo with Vision. The function will extract information about the employees, their roles, and their managers from the image. We will use function/tool calling to specify the input parameters for the organizational structure, such as the employee name, role, and manager's name and role. We will use Pydantic models to define the structure of the data.\n\nNow, we will define a function to parse the response from GPT-4 Turbo with Vision and extract the employee data. We will tabulate the extracted data for easy visualization. Please note that the accuracy of the extracted data may vary based on the complexity and clarity of the input image.\nThe extracted data from the organizational chart has been successfully parsed and displayed in a DataFrame. This approach allows us to leverage GPT-4 Turbo with Vision capabilities to extract structured information from images, such as organizational charts and diagrams, and process the data for further analysis.

This could be used in a number of scenarios such as training a data science  machine learning model (SVMs, decision trees, KNN's), finetuning a different GPT model on the data, as a solution to the coldstart problem, helping build compelling demos/apps with realistic data, scenario testing etc.\n\nThere are a number of key drivers which may see you wanting to leverage synthetic data.\nHuman data may have privacy restrictions and/or identifiable data within it which we do not want to be used.\nSynthetic data can be much more structured and therefore easier to manipulate than real data.\nIn domains where data is sparse or data of certain categories is sparse we may want to augment the data.\nWhen dealing with imbalanced datasets or datasets which lack diversity, we may want to create data to improve the richness of our datasets.\n\nUnlike traditional data augmentation or manual data creation methods, using LLMs allows for the generation of rich, nuanced, and contextually relevant datasets that can significantly enhance it's usefulness to enterprises and developers.\n\nWe split this tutorial into 2 parts. In this cookbook, we will have the following agenda:\nCSV with a structured prompt\nCSV with a Python program\nMultitable CSV with a python program\nSimply creating textual data\nDealing with imbalanced or non-diverse textual data\nwhile in part 2, we will look at prompting strategies for getting better textual data.\n\nThe last two in particular are useful for creating synthetic data to finetune another GPT model. For example using higher quality data produced by gpt-4 to finetune the cheaper and quicker gpt-3.5 for improved performance while reducing costs.\n\nGetting setup\n1. CSV with a structure prompt\nHere we create data in the simplest way. You can quickly generate data by addressing 3 key points: telling it the format of the data (CSV), the schema, and useful information regarding how columns relate (the LLM will be able to deduce this from the column names but a helping hand will improve performance).\n2. CSV with a Python program\nThe issue with generating data directly is we are limited in the amount of data we can generate because of the context. Instead what we can do is ask the LLM to generate a python program to generate the synthetic data. This allows us to scale to much more data while also providing us a view into how the data was generated by inspecting the python program.\n\nThis would then let us edit the python program as we desire while giving us a good basis to start from.\n\nWe need to make sure to parse the output of this appropriately as often there may be surrounding text to the python code. We can also explicitly ask it to state all assumptions it made about the data it's generating, however in this circumstance it told us that automatically.\n3. Multitable CSV with a python program\nFor more complex relationships however we need to make sure to specify a few more characteristics.\n\nTo create multiple different datasets which relate to each other (for example housing, location, house type), as before we would need to specify the format, schema and useful information. However, the useful information required to get good performance is higher now. It's case-specific but a good amount of things to describe would be how the datasets relate to each other, addressing the size of the datasets in relation to one another, making sure foreign and primary keys are made appropriately and ideally using previously generated datasets to populate new ones so the actual data values match where necessary.\n4. Simply creating textual data\nHere we take a first look at creating textual data. This can be used to finetune another GPT model for example. In this case we imagine ourselves a retailer trying to streamline the process of creating descriptions for items they are selling. We again need to specify the format of the data, in particular in this case we want one which is easy to parse as an output.\nThe example we consider below is one in which we want to create input output training pairs for GPT model to finetune on. We will have the products' name and the category it belongs to as input and the output will be a description.\n\nSpecifying the structure of the output explicitly and giving commands to not deviate from this help enforce the output structure. You can run this in a loop and append the data to generate more synthetic data. Again, as before we will need to parse the data well so that our code further downstream does not break.\nNote: the above output is truncated. And now we can parse it as below to get a list of products, categories and their descriptions. For example, let's take a look at the products it's generated.\n\n5. Dealing with imbalanced or non-diverse textual data\nSome of the most important aspects of generating high-quality synthetic data are accuracy (does the data make sense), consistency (are two separate data points for the same input roughly the same) and diversity (making sure our data distribution matches as much of the distribution that exists in production).\n\n\nTo increase the diversity of our data, we start first by clustering the data. This will provide us information about which clusters are underrepresented (imbalanced dataset) or which data is not addressed at all (widening the data distribution). Then, we will either suggest new clusters (using self-reflection type call from GPT) or ask the next iteration of our synthetic generation calls to explicitly target the underrepresented clusters.\n\nWe can then recursively run this generation and analysis of cluster loop to automate generating diverse synthetic data.\nFor demonstrative purposes, we explicitly prompt the LLM to generate information about 4 different topical areas: vehicle, clothing, toiletries, food. We will then cluster the data and see if it managed to find these 4 topic areas.\nNote: The above output is truncated. In the example above, we would explicitly include the topic area as part of the response per example as it helps condition the proceeding output and tends to give better performance. We can also give it an actual example of what the output should look like so it gets the right idea of style of output but also to help enforce structure.\nWe will now cluster the data to analyze it. We will use K-means clustering to segregate the data. An important parameter of K-means to set is K, the number of clusters.\n\nWe know that there should be 4 cluster (4 topics) since we specified this in prompt: vehicle, electronics, clothing, food. However in general for our data, we do not know the number of clusters that exist. Therefore we will use the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.\n\nIn the elbow method, we iterate through a range of different K's, each time storing the inertia. The inertia measures the sum of the squared distances between each point in a cluster and the centroid of that cluster thus telling us how well-separated and dense each cluster is. If we plot K against the inertia, we are able to see how the inertia drops and where the drop in inertia is least rapid (often making an elbow shape) we can set our optimal number of clusters. You can read into more depth about the elbow method here).\nFirst let's store our data into a pandas dataframe for ease of analysis\n\n\nNext let us embed our data as the embeddings is what we will cluster since they should be close to each other in vector space if they are similar.\nNow we perform the elbow method.\nThis will output a chart for us in which we have to visually tell where the optimal cluster point is. We can see below that we see a gradual decrease of inertia rather than a sharp elbow but the point of steepest decrease appears to occur around 3, 4 or 5 clusters which lines up with our expectations given our prompt.\nelbow_chart\nFor demonstration purposes we will pick 5 as the optimal cluster number to show it doesn't matter exactly where we pick it as long as we are approximately right. There are numerous correct ways to categorize data. We also store which cluster each data point belongs to.\nWe will analyze the cluster data now. There are two separate things we will look to address. 1. imbalanced data, 2. Expanding the data distribution.\nFirst for imbalanced data we count the number of examples in each cluster. Then we select a few examples from each cluster at random and ask the LLM what topics these map to.\nWe can see the topics found here:\nEco-friendly Transportation, Luxury and Leisure Items, Personal Care Products, Electronic Toothbrushes and Clothing and Apparel\nmatch well enough but not exactly to our initial prompt of:\nvehicle, clothing, toiletries, food.\n\nAs we chose 5 clusters, it split up toiletries into Skincare and Personal Care which doesn't affect us too much further downstream.\nWe now have the clusters and their counts so we could prompt the LLM to generate more examples within the topics we want. However for this example we won't take that further as they are well-split and you would just follow the procedure above for prompting the model to generate data while passing in the underrepresented topics.\nNext, we will try and deal with increasing the diversity of our data distribution.\n\nFirst we start in a similar way by finding a few examples from each cluster at random and ask the LLM what topics these map to. In addition to this in the same LLM call, we will ask it to generate more topics to increase the diversity of our data. We do this in one call to save time/cost.\nWe can see here again that we explicitly prompt the output structure it should follow. I also tell it the purpose of generating topics (to promote diversity) so the model has full context.\nWe then parse the data into a list of cluster-mapping jsons and a list of topics\nAnd finally we can use this information to further prompt a model to keep generating synthetic data. We do this by passing all the topics in the list of jsons to the prompt below.\nYou can run this in a loop to append to your previous data and in this way you can keep generating more textual synthetic data to train another GPT model while making sure that we cater to imbalanced datasets and generating a diversity of data.\nYou have now completed part 1 of the synthetic data generation tutorial where we have gone through:\nCSV with a structured prompt\nCSV with a Python program\nMultitable CSV with a python program\nSimply creating textual data\nDealing with imbalanced or non-diverse textual data\n\nIn part 2 you will find find out techniques for better prompting an LLM to enhance textual synthetic data generation."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"91:T14d6,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nMultimodal RAG integrates additional modalities into traditional text-based RAG, enhancing LLMs' question-answering by providing extra context and grounding textual data for improved understanding.\n\nAdopting the approach from the clothing matchmaker cookbook, we directly embed images for similarity search, bypassing the lossy process of text captioning, to boost retrieval accuracy.\n\nUsing CLIP-based embeddings further allows fine-tuning with specific data or updating with unseen images.\n\nThis technique is showcased through searching an enterprise knowledge base with user-provided tech images to deliver pertinent information.\nInstallations\nFirst let's install the relevant packages.\nThen let's import all the needed packages.\n\nNow let's load the CLIP model.\n\nWe will now:\nCreate the image embedding database\nSet up a query to the vision model\nPerform the semantic search\nPass a user query to the image\n\nCreate image embedding database\nNext we will create our image embeddings knowledge base from a directory of images. This will be the knowledge base of technology that we search through to provide information to the user for an image they upload.\n\nWe pass in the directory in which we store our images (as JPEGs) and loop through each to create our embeddings.\n\nWe also have a description.json. This has an entry for every single image in our knowledge base. It has two keys: 'image_path' and 'description'. It maps each image to a useful description of this image to aid in answering the user question.\nFirst let's write a function to get all the image paths in a given directory. We will then get all the jpeg's from a directory called 'image_database'\nNext we will write a function to get the image embeddings from the CLIP model given a series of paths.\n\nWe first preprocess the image using the preprocess function we got earlier. This performs a few things to ensure the input to the CLIP model is of the right format and dimensionality including resizing, normalization, colour channel adjustment etc.\n\nWe then stack these preprocessed images together so we can pass them into the model at once rather than in a loop. And finally return the model output which is an array of embeddings.\nWe can now create our vector database.\nAnd also ingest our json for image-description mapping and create a list of jsons. We also create a helper function to search through this list for a given image we want, so we can obtain the description of that image\nLet us display an example image, this will be the user uploaded image. This is a piece of tech that was unveiled at the 2024 CES. It is the DELTA Pro Ultra Whole House Battery Generator.\nDelta Pro\nQuerying the vision model\nNow let's have a look at what GPT-4 Vision (which wouldn't have seen this technology before) will label it as.\n\n\nFirst we will need to write a function to encode our image in base64 as this is the format we will pass into the vision model. Then we will create a generic image_query function to allow us to query the LLM with an image input.\nAs we can see, it tries its best from the information it's been trained on but it makes a mistake due to it not having seen anything similar in its training data. This is because it is an ambiguous image making it difficult to extrapolate and deduce.\nPerforming semantic search\nNow let's perform similarity search to find the two most similar images in our knowledge base. We do this by getting the embeddings of a user inputted image_path, retrieving the indexes and distances of the similar iamges in our database. Distance will be our proxy metric for similarity and a smaller distance means more similar. We then sort based on distance in descending order.\nWe require the indices as we will use this to serach through our image_directory and selecting the image at the location of the index to feed into the vision model for RAG.\nAnd let's see what it brought back (we display these in order of similarity):\nDelta Pro2\n\nDelta Pro3\nWe can see here it brought back two images which contain the DELTA Pro Ultra Whole House Battery Generator. In one of the images it also has some background which could be distracting but manages to find the right image.\nUser querying the most similar image\nNow for our most similar image, we want to pass it and the description of it to gpt-v with a user query so they can inquire about the technology that they may have bought. This is where the power of the vision model comes in, where you can ask general queries for which the model hasn't been explicitly trained on to the model and it responds with high accuracy.\nIn our example below, we will inquire as to the capacity of the item in question.\nAnd we see it is able to answer the question. This was only possible by matching images directly and from there gathering the relevant description as context.\nConclusion\nIn this notebook, we have gone through how to use the CLIP model, an example of creating an image embedding database using the CLIP model, performing semantic search and finally providing a user query to answer the question.\nThe applications of this pattern of usage spread across many different application domains and this is easily improved to further enhance the technique. For example you may finetune CLIP, you may improve the retrieval process just like in RAG and you can prompt engineer GPT-V."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"92:Tf14,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nThe new Batch API allows to create async batch jobs for a lower price and with higher rate limits.\n\nBatches will be completed within 24h, but may be processed sooner depending on global usage.\n\nIdeal use cases for the Batch API include:\n\nTagging, captioning, or enriching content on a marketplace or blog\nCategorizing and suggesting answers for support tickets\nPerforming sentiment analysis on large datasets of customer feedback\nGenerating summaries or translations for collections of documents or articles\n\nand much more!\n\nThis cookbook will walk you through how to use the Batch API with a couple of practical examples.\n\nWe will start with an example to categorize movies using gpt-3.5-turbo, and then cover how we can use the vision capabilities of gpt-4-turbo to caption images.\n\nPlease note that multiple models are available through the Batch API, and that you can use the same parameters in your Batch API calls as with the Chat Completions endpoint.\nSetup\nFirst example: Categorizing movies\n\nIn this example, we will use gpt-3.5-turbo to extract movie categories from a description of the movie.

GPT-4o will integrate these capabilities into a single model that's trained across text, vision, and audio. This unified approach ensures that all inputs—whether text, visual, or auditory—are processed cohesively by the same neural network.\n\nCurrent API Capabilities\nCurrently, the API supports {text, image} inputs only, with {text} outputs, the same modalities as gpt-4-turbo. Additional modalities, including audio, will be introduced soon. This guide will help you get started with using GPT-4o for text, image, and video understanding.\n\nGetting Started\nInstall OpenAI SDK for Python\n\nConfigure the OpenAI client and submit a test request\nTo setup the client for our use, we need to create an API key to use with our request. Skip these steps if you already have an API key for usage.\n\nYou can get an API key by following these steps:\nCreate a new project\nGenerate an API key in your project\n(RECOMMENDED, BUT NOT REQUIRED) Setup your API key for all projects as an env var\n\nOnce we have this setup, let's start with a simple {text} input to the model for our first request. We'll use both system and user messages for our first request, and we'll receive a response from the assistant role.\nImage Processing\nGPT-4o can directly process images and take intelligent actions based on the image. We can provide images in two formats:\nBase64 Encoded\nURL\n\nLet's first view the image we'll use, then try sending this image as both Base64 and as a URL link to the API\nBase64 Image Processing\nURL Image Processing\nVideo Processing\nWhile it's not possible to directly send a video to the API, GPT-4o can understand videos if you sample frames and then provide them as images. It performs better at this task than GPT-4 Turbo.\n\nSince GPT-4o in the API does not yet support audio-in (as of May 2024), we'll use a combination of GPT-4o and Whisper to process both the audio and visual for a provided video, and showcase two usecases:\nSummarization\nQuestion and Answering\n\nSetup for Video Processing\nWe'll use two python packages for video processing - opencv-python and moviepy.\n\nThese require ffmpeg, so make sure to install this beforehand. Depending on your OS, you may need to run brew install ffmpeg or sudo apt install ffmpeg\nProcess the video into two components: frames and audio\nExample 1: Summarization\nNow that we have both the video frames and the audio, let's run a few different tests to generate a video summary to compare the results of using the models with different modalities. We should expect to see that the summary generated with context from both visual and audio inputs will be the most accurate, as the model is able to use the entire context from the video.\n\nVisual Summary\nAudio Summary\nVisual + Audio Summary\n\nVisual Summary\nThe visual summary is generated by sending the model only the frames from the video. With just the frames, the model is likely to capture the visual aspects, but will miss any details discussed by the speaker.\nThe results are as expected - the model is able to capture the high level aspects of the video visuals, but misses the details provided in the speech.\n\nAudio Summary\nThe audio summary is generated by sending the model the audio transcript. With just the audio, the model is likely to bias towards the audio content, and will miss the context provided by the presentations and visuals.\n\n{audio} input for GPT-4o isn't currently available but will be coming soon! For now, we use our existing whisper-1 model to process the audio\nThe audio summary is biased towards the content discussed during the speech, but comes out with much less structure than the video summary.\n\nAudio + Visual Summary\nThe Audio + Visual summary is generated by sending the model both the visual and the audio from the video at once. When sending both of these, the model is expected to better summarize since it can perceive the entire video at once.\nAfter combining both the video and audio, we're able to get a much more detailed and comprehensive summary for the event which uses information from both the visual and audio elements from the video.\n\nExample 2: Question and Answering\nFor the Q\u0026A, we'll use the same concept as before to ask questions of our processed video while running the same 3 tests to demonstrate the benefit of combining input modalities:\nVisual Q\u0026A\nAudio Q\u0026A\nVisual + Audio Q\u0026A\nComparing the three answers, the most accurate answer is generated by using both the audio and visual from the video. Sam Altman did not discuss the raising windows or radio on during the Keynote, but referenced an improved capability for the model to execute multiple functions in a single request while the examples were shown behind him.\n\nConclusion\nIntegrating many input modalities such as audio, visual, and textual, significantly enhances the performance of the model on a diverse range of tasks. This multimodal approach allows for more comprehensive understanding and interaction, mirroring more closely how humans perceive and process information.\n\nCurrently, GPT-4o in the API supports text and image inputs, with audio capabilities coming soon."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"95:Ta485,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nOverview\n\nThis solution enables a GPT action to answer a user’s question with the context of files the user can access in SharePoint or Office365, using Microsoft’s Graph API search capabilities and the ability to retrieve files. It uses Azure Functions to process the Graph API response and convert it to a human readable format or structure it in a way ChatGPT understands. This code is meant to be directional, and you should modify it to your requirements.\n\nHow it Works\n\nThere are two solutions below, with code for each in the repository. \n\nThe first solution Solution 1 uses the ability to retrieve files in Actions and use them as if you had uploaded them directly to a conversation. The Azure Function returns a base64 string that ChatGPT converts into a file, treated the same way as if you uploaded the file directly to the conversation. This solution can handle more types of files than the other solution below, but does have size volume limitations (see docs here)\n\nThe second solution Solution 2 pre-processes the file within the Azure Function. The Azure Function returns text, instead of the base64 encoded file. Due to the pre-processing and the conversion to text, this solution is best used for large, unstructured documents, and for when you want to analyze more than the amount of files supported in the first solution (see documentation here).\n\nSolution 1: Returning the file to GPT using the Returning Files pattern\n\n\n\n\nThis solution uses a Node.js Azure Function to, based on the logged in user:\n\nSearch for a relevant file that the user has access to, based on the user’s initial question. \n\nFor each file that is found, convert it to a base64 string.\n\nFormat the data in the structure ChatGPT is expecting here.\n\nReturn that to ChatGPT. The GPT then can use those files as if you had uploaded it to the conversation.\n\nSolution 2: Converting the file to text in the Azure Function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis solution uses a Node.js Azure Function to, based on the logged in user:\n\nSearch for a relevant file that the user has access to, based on the user’s initial question.\n\nFor each file that is found, convert it to a consistent readable format and retrieve all the text.\n\nUse GPT 3.5-turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) to extract the relevant text from the files based on the initial user’s question. Note the pricing of GPT 3.5 turbo here - since we are dealing with small token chunks, the cost of this step is nominal.  \n\nReturns that data to ChatGPT. The GPT then uses that information to respond to the user's initial question.\n\nAs you can see from the below architecture diagram, the first three steps are the same as Solution 1. The main difference is that this solution converts the file to text instead of a base64 string, and then summarizes that text using GPT 3.5 Turbo.\n\nWhy is this necessary instead of interacting with the Microsoft API directly?\n\nFollowing the guide here, the Microsoft Graph Search API returns references to files that fit the criteria, but not the file contents themselves. So, we need have two options, corresponding to the two solutions above:\n\n  Solution 1: restructure the response for compatibility: \n\n    We need to restructure the response from that API so that it matches the expected structure in openaiFileResponse outlined here.\n\n  Solution 2: extract the text from the files directly:\n\n    loop through the returned files and download the files using the Download File endpoint or Convert File endpoint\n\n    convert that Binary stream to human readable text using pdf-parse\n\n    Then, we can optimize further by summarizing using gpt-3.5-turbo in the function to help with the 100,000 character limit we impose on Actions today. \n\nPrerequisites\n\nAzure Portal with access to create Azure Function Apps and Azure Entra App Registrations\n\nPostman (and knowledge of APIs and OAuth)\n\nSolution 2 Only: An OpenAI API Key from platform.openai.com\n\nSolution 1 + Solution 2 Installation Instructions\n\nThe below are the instructions for setting up the Azure Function with Authentication. Please make sure to follow these steps before implementing the code.\nThese installation instructions apply to both Solution 1 and Solution 2. We encourage setting both solutions up as separate functions within the same Function App to test which works best for you, as once you set up one function, it takes only a few minutes to set up another function in that same function app.\n\nInstalling the app\n\nYou can read more about languages and deployment options for Azure Functions on the left hand side of the documentation here. \n\nOption 1: Use VSCode\n\nSee Microsoft’s documentation here for how to deploy using VSCode. If you have familiarity with this approach, feel free to use it. \n\nOption 2: Directly in Azure Portal\n\nSee the documentation here for how to deploy using the Azure portal. We’ll walk through an example here step by step.\nNote: you can use Part 1 - Part 4 below to set up any Azure Function App with Entra Authentication\n\nPart 1: Create Function\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an Azure Function app. I used the following settings but you can use anything you are comfortable with. Note that not every language / operating system allows for editing the functions in the console directly - the combination I chose below does. For my walkthrough, I left everything as default and made the selections below\n\n   Basics\n\n      Do you want to deploy code or container image?:  Code\n\n      Runtime stack: Node.js\n\n      Operating system: Windows\n\n   Networking\n\n      Enable public access: on (need this on to connect to the GPT)\n\nAfter completing the above, you’ll land on the “Deployments” page. Once the deployment completes (which should only take a few minutes) click on “Go to Resource” to go back to the Function App\nYou may get an error the first time you attempt this, click create again and it will likely work.\n\nPart 2: Set up Auth\n\nOn the left-hand side menu of the Azure Function App, click on Authentication under the Settings menu. \n\n   Add identity provider\n\n   Select Microsoft as identity provider. \n\n   Workforce as tenant type\n\n   Create a new application. The instructions are fairly similar if you are using an existing application, but it is easier to create a new application as it will have the callback URLs and the API exposed automatically using “Easy Auth”. You can read more about that here.\n\n   Leave all the other settings on this page as the default, but feel free to change based on your internal guidelines.\n\n   On the permissions tab, click Add Permission and add Files.Read.All, then Add. This allows this application to read files which is important in order to use the Microsoft Graph Search API.\n\nOnce it is created, click on the enterprise application you just created (so, leave the Function App page and land on the Enterprise Application that you just spun up). We are now going to give it one more permission, to execute the Azure Function by impersonating the user logging into the application. See here for more details.\n\n   On the main page, click “View API Permissions”\n\n   Search for Microsoft Azure App Service in the APIs my organization uses and find user\\_impersonation \n\n   Add it, then you’ll need an Admin on Azure Portal to Grant Admin Consent.\n\n5) Within that enterprise application, Click on “Expose an API” on the left hand menu under Manage, then copy the scope that was created using the Copy to Clipboard button. The scope should look like “api://\\/user\\_impersonation”. Save this for later as SCOPE.\n\n6) Click on “Authentication” on the left hand menu under Manage\n\n   Under the Web section, you’ll notice one callback URI was added automatically. Add the Postman redirect URI () for testing.\n\n7) On the left-hand side, go to Overview. Copy the application (client) ID and and the directory (tenant) ID and save for later as CLIENT_ID and TENANT_ID.\n\nPart 3: Set up Test Function\n\nLeave the page by going home and then back to your Function App.\n\nClick on Create Function. For this example, I’m going to develop it in the portal, but you can also use VSCode or another IDE.\n\n   Choose HTTP trigger\n\n   For Authorization Level, you can choose any key type you want.\n\n      Note this may error out the first time, but it is likely the Function did create, do a refresh of the page to check.\n\nClick on the function you just created (You may need to click refresh to see it). Click on Get Function URL and save it to test in Postman. You will also use this when creating the OpenAPI spec later when you put it into the GPT. \n\n\n\n\n\nGo back to the function app and click on Configuration. Show the value for the MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET variable, copy it (click advanced edit to copy it), and save it for later.  \n\nAt this point, you should have a test function created, and you should have saved a client id, tenant id, secret, scope, and function URL. You are now ready to test out the authentication in Postman\n\nPart 4: Test Authentication in Postman\n\nTry to hit endpoint you created in Postman using those OAuth settings:\n\n    Grant Type: Authorization Code\n\n    Auth URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/authorize\n\n    Auth Token URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/token\n\n    Client ID: CLIENT_ID from step 7 above\n\n    Client secret: MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET from step 11 above\n\n    Scope: SCOPE from step 5 above\n\n    Client credentials: Send client credentials in body\n\nYou will need to click Get New Access Token, and then hit the endpoint you saved in step 10 above. If it was successful, you should get this response: ”This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.”\n\nPart 5: Add in Function Code\n\nNow that you have an authenticated Azure Function, we can update the function to search SharePoint / O365\n\nGo to your test function and paste in the code from this file for Solution 1 and this file for Solution 2.  Save the function. \nThis code is meant to be directional - while it should work out of the box, it is designed to be customized to your needs (see examples towards the end of this document).\n\nSet up the following env variables by going to the Configuration tab on the left under Settings. Note that this may be listed directly in Environment Variables depending on your Azure UI.\n\n    TENANT_ID: copied from previous section\n\n    CLIENT_ID: copied from previous section\n\n    Solution 2 only:\n\n       OPENAI_API_KEY: spin up an OpenAI API key on platform.openai.com.\n\nGo to the Console tab under the Development Tools\n\n    Install the following packages in console\n\n       npm install @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client\n\n       npm install axios\n\n       Solution 2 only:\n\n          npm install pdf-parse\n\n          npm install openai\n\nOnce this is complete, try calling the function (POST call) from Postman again, putting the below into body (using a query and search term you think will generate responses).\n\n     Solution 1:\n         {\n        \"searchTerm\": \"\"\n    }\n        Solution 2:\n        {\n        \"query\": \"\",\n        \"searchTerm\": \"\"\n    }\n    If you get a response, you are ready to set this up with a Custom GPT!\n\nPart 6: Setting it up in a Custom GPT\n\nGenerate an OpenAPI spec for your endpoint. \n\nPaste that into the Actions section of a GPT, and choose OAuth as the authentication type. Fill out the OAuth settings the same way you did for Postman above. \n\nOnce you save the action, you will see a callback URI at the bottom of the GPT configuration. Copy that URL, then go back to your Function App in the Azure Portal.\n\nClick on Authentication under Settings, then click on your Entra application.\n\nOnce you are there, then click Authentication under the Manage section.\n\nAdd a new Redirect URI under the Web section of that page, and paste in the Callback URI you got from step 20, then click Save. \n\nCustomize the prompt to use this action. You can see a sample prompt in the Sample GPT Instructions in this document, which is customized to try three times to find an answer by changing the searchTerm. \n\nTest out the GPT and it should work as expected.\n\nSolution 1 Detailed Walkthrough: Returning the File to GPT using the Returning Files Pattern\n\nThe below walks through setup instructions and walkthroughs unique to this solution. If you are interested in Solution 2 instead, you can jump here.\n\nCode Walkthrough\n\nThe below walks through the different parts of the function. Before you begin, ensure you have the required packages installed and environment variables set up (see the Installation Steps section).\n\nImplementing the Authentication \n\nBelow we have a few helper functions that we’ll use in the function.\n\nInitializing the Microsoft Graph Client\n\nCreate a function to initialize the Graph client with an access token. This will be used to search through Office 365 and SharePoint.\n\nconst { Client } = require('@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client');\n\nfunction initGraphClient(accessToken) {\n    return Client.init({\n        authProvider: (done) =\u003e {\n            done(null, accessToken);\n        }\n    });\n}\n\nObtaining an On-Behalf-Of (OBO) Token\n\nThis function uses an existing bearer token to request an OBO token from Microsoft's identity platform. This enables passing through the credentials to ensure the search only returns files the logged-in user can access.\n\nconst axios = require('axios');\nconst qs = require('querystring');\n\nasync function getOboToken(userAccessToken) {\n    const { TENANT_ID, CLIENT_ID, MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET } = process.env;\n    const params = {\n        client_id: CLIENT_ID,\n        client_secret: MICROSOFT\\_PROVIDER\\_AUTHENTICATION\\_SECRET,\n        grant_type: 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer',\n        assertion: userAccessToken,\n        requested_token_use: 'on_behalf_of',\n        scope: 'https://graph.microsoft.com/.default'\n    };\n\n    const url = https\\://login.microsoftonline.com/${TENANT_ID}/oauth2/v2.0/token;\n    try {\n        const response = await axios.post(url, qs.stringify(params), {\n            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' }\n        });\n        return response.data.access\\_token;\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error obtaining OBO token:', error.response?.data || error.message);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n\nRetrieving Content from O365 / SharePoint Items\n\nThis function fetches the content of drive items, converts it to a base64 string, and restructures to match the openaiFileResponse format.\nconst getDriveItemContent = async (client, driveId, itemId, name) =\u003e {\n   try\n       const filePath = /drives/${driveId}/items/${itemId};\n       const downloadPath = filePath + /content\n       // this is where we get the contents and convert to base64\n       const fileStream = await client.api(downloadPath).getStream();\n       let chunks = [];\n           for await (let chunk of fileStream) {\n               chunks.push(chunk);\n           }\n       const base64String = Buffer.concat(chunks).toString('base64');\n       // this is where we get the other metadata to include in response\n       const file = await client.api(filePath).get();\n       const mime_type = file.file.mimeType;\n       const name = file.name;\n       return {\"name\":name, \"mime_type\":mime_type, \"content\":base64String}\n   } catch (error) {\n       console.error('Error fetching drive content:', error);\n       throw new Error(Failed to fetch content for ${name}: ${error.message});\n   }\n\nCreating the Azure Function to Handle Requests\n\nNow that we have all these helper functions, the Azure Function will orchestrate the flow, by authenticating the user, performing the search, and iterating through the search results to extract the text and retrieve the relevant parts of the text to the GPT.\n\nHandling HTTP Requests: The function starts by extracting the query and searchTerm from the HTTP request. It checks if the Authorization header is present and extracts the bearer token.\n\nAuthentication: Using the bearer token, it obtains an OBO token from Microsoft's identity platform using getOboToken defined above.\n\nInitializing the Graph Client: With the OBO token, it initializes the Microsoft Graph client using initGraphClient defined above.\n\nDocument Search: It constructs a search query and sends it to the Microsoft Graph API to find documents based on the searchTerm.\n\nDocument Processing: For each document returned by the search:\n\nIt retrieves the document content using getDriveItemContent.\n\nIt converts the document to base64 string and restructures it to match the openaiFileResponse structure.\n\nResponse: The function sends them back in the HTTP response.\nmodule.exports = async function (context, req) {\n   // const query = req.query.query || (req.body \u0026\u0026 req.body.query);\n   const searchTerm = req.query.searchTerm || (req.body \u0026\u0026 req.body.searchTerm);\n   if (!req.headers.authorization) {\n       context.res = {\n           status: 400,\n           body: 'Authorization header is missing'\n       };\n       return;\n   }\n   /// The below takes the token passed to the function, to use to get an OBO token.\n   const bearerToken = req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1];\n   let accessToken;\n   try {\n       accessToken = await getOboToken(bearerToken);\n   } catch (error) {\n       context.res = {\n           status: 500,\n           body: Failed to obtain OBO token: ${error.message}\n       };\n       return;\n   }\n   // Initialize the Graph Client using the initGraphClient function defined above\n   let client = initGraphClient(accessToken);\n   // this is the search body to be used in the Microsft Graph Search API: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/search-concept-files\n   const requestBody = {\n       requests: [\n           {\n               entityTypes: ['driveItem'],\n               query: {\n                   queryString: searchTerm\n               },\n               from: 0,\n               // the below is set to summarize the top 10 search results from the Graph API, but can configure based on your documents.\n               size: 10\n           }\n       ]\n   };\n\n\n   try {\n       // This is where we are doing the search\n       const list = await client.api('/search/query').post(requestBody);\n       const processList = async () =\u003e {\n           // This will go through and for each search response, grab the contents of the file and summarize with gpt-3.5-turbo\n           const results = [];\n           await Promise.all(list.value[0].hitsContainers.map(async (container) =\u003e {\n               for (const hit of container.hits) {\n                   if (hit.resource[\"@odata.type\"] === \"#microsoft.graph.driveItem\") {\n                       const { name, id } = hit.resource;\n                       // The below is where the file lives\n                       const driveId = hit.resource.parentReference.driveId;\n                       // we use the helper function we defined above to get the contents, convert to base64, and restructure it\n                       const contents = await getDriveItemContent(client, driveId, id, name);\n                       results.push(contents)\n               }\n           }));\n           return results;\n       };\n       let results;\n       if (list.value[0].hitsContainers[0].total == 0) {\n           // Return no results found to the API if the Microsoft Graph API returns no results\n           results = 'No results found';\n       } else {\n           // If the Microsoft Graph API does return results, then run processList to iterate through.\n           results = await processList();\n           // this is where we structure the response so ChatGPT knows they are files\n           results = {'openaiFileResponse': results}\n       }\n       context.res = {\n           status: 200,\n           body: results\n       };\n   } catch (error) {\n       context.res = {\n           status: 500,\n           body: Error performing search or processing results: ${error.message},\n       };\n   }\n};\nCustomizations\n\nBelow are some potential areas to customize. \n\nYou can customize the GPT prompt to search again a certain amount of times if nothing is found.\n\nYou can customize the code to only search through specific SharePoint sites or O365 Drives by customizing the search query. This will help focus the search and improve the retrieval. The function as setup now looks through all files the logged-in user can access.\n\nYou can update the code to only return certain types of files. For example, only return structured data / CSVs. \n\nYou can customize the amount of files it searches through within the call to Microsoft Graph. Note that you should only put a maximum of 10 files based on the documentation here. \n\nConsiderations\n\nNote that all the same limitations of Actions apply here, with regards to returning 100K characters or less and the 45 second timeout.\n\nMake sure you read the documentation here around returning files and file uploads, as those limitations apply here.\n\nSample GPT Instructions\n\n\nYou are a Q\u0026A helper that helps answer users questions. You have access to a documents repository through your API action. When a user asks a question, you pass in the \"searchTerm\" a single keyword or term you think you should use for the search.\n\nScenario 1: There are answers\n\nIf your action returns results, then you take the results from the action and try to answer the users question. \n\nScenario 2: No results found\n\nIf the response you get from the action is \"No results found\", stop there and let the user know there were no results and that you are going to try a different search term, and explain why. You must always let the user know before conducting another search.\n\nExample:\n\nI found no results for \"DEI\". I am now going to try [insert term] because [insert explanation]\n\nThen, try a different searchTerm that is similar to the one you tried before, with a single word. \n\nTry this three times. After the third time, then let the user know you did not find any relevant documents to answer the question, and to check SharePoint.\nBe sure to be explicit about what you are searching for at each step.\n\nIn either scenario, try to answer the user's question. If you cannot answer the user's question based on the knowledge you find, let the user know and ask them to go check the HR Docs in SharePoint. \nSample OpenAPI Spec\nThis expects a response that matches the file retrieval structure in our doc here and passes in a searchTerm parameter to inform the search.\nMake sure to switch the function app name, function name and code based on link copied in screenshot here\n\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: SharePoint Search API\n  description: API for searching SharePoint documents.\n  version: 1.0.0\nservers:\n  url: https://{your_function_app_name}.azurewebsites.net/api\n    description: SharePoint Search API server\npaths:\n  /{your_function_name}?code={enter your specific endpoint id here}:\n    post:\n      operationId: searchSharePoint\n      summary: Searches SharePoint for documents matching a query and term.\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                searchTerm:\n                  type: string\n                  description: A specific term to search for within the documents.\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: A CSV file of query results encoded in base64.\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                type: object\n                properties:\n                  openaiFileResponseData:\n                    type: array\n                    items:\n                      type: object\n                      properties:\n                        name:\n                          type: string\n                          description: The name of the file.\n                        mime_type:\n                          type: string\n                          description: The MIME type of the file.\n                        content:\n                          type: string\n                          format: byte\n                          description: The base64 encoded contents of the file.\n        '400':\n          description: Bad request when the SQL query parameter is missing.\n        '413':\n          description: Payload too large if the response exceeds the size limit.\n        '500':\n          description: Server error when there are issues executing the query or encoding the results.\n\nSolution 2 Detailed Walkthrough: Converting the file to text in the Azure Function\n\nThe below walks through setup instructions and walkthroughs unique to this solution of pre-processing the files and extracting summaries in the Azure Function.\n\nCode Walkthrough\n\nImplementing the Authentication \n\nThis solution follows the same authentication steps as solution 1 above - see Initializing the Microsoft Graph Client and Obtaining an On-Behalf-Of (OBO) Token sections.\n\nRetrieving Content from O365 / SharePoint Items\n\nThis function fetches the content of drive items, handling different file types and converting files to PDF when necessary for text extraction. This uses the download endpoint for PDFs and the convert endpoint for other supported file types.\nconst getDriveItemContent = async (client, driveId, itemId, name) =\u003e {\n    try {\n        const fileType = path.extname(name).toLowerCase();\n        // the below files types are the ones that are able to be converted to PDF to extract the text.

It checks if the Authorization header is present and extracts the bearer token.\n\nAuthentication: Using the bearer token, it obtains an OBO token from Microsoft's identity platform using getOboToken defined above.\n\nInitializing the Graph Client: With the OBO token, it initializes the Microsoft Graph client using initGraphClient defined above.\n\nDocument Search: It constructs a search query and sends it to the Microsoft Graph API to find documents based on the searchTerm.\n\nDocument Processing: For each document returned by the search:\n\nIt retrieves the document content using getDriveItemContent.\n\nIf the file type is supported, it analyzes the content using getRelevantParts, which sends the text to OpenAI's model for extracting relevant information based on the query.\n\nIt collects the analysis results and includes metadata like the document name and URL.\n\nResponse: The function sorts the results by relevance and sends them back in the HTTP response.\n\nmodule.exports = async function (context, req) {\n    const query = req.query.query || (req.body \u0026\u0026 req.body.query);\n    const searchTerm = req.query.searchTerm || (req.body \u0026\u0026 req.body.searchTerm);\n    if (!req.headers.authorization) {\n        context.res = {\n            status: 400,\n            body: 'Authorization header is missing'\n        };\n        return;\n    }\n    /// The below takes the token passed to the function, to use to get an OBO token.\n    const bearerToken = req.headers.authorization.split(' ')[1];\n    let accessToken;\n    try {\n        accessToken = await getOboToken(bearerToken);\n    } catch (error) {\n        context.res = {\n            status: 500,\n            body: Failed to obtain OBO token: ${error.message}\n        };\n        return;\n    }\n    // Initialize the Graph Client using the initGraphClient function defined above\n    let client = initGraphClient(accessToken);\n    // this is the search body to be used in the Microsft Graph Search API: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/search-concept-files\n    const requestBody = {\n        requests: [\n            {\n                entityTypes: ['driveItem'],\n                query: {\n                    queryString: searchTerm\n                },\n                from: 0,\n                // the below is set to summarize the top 10 search results from the Graph API, but can configure based on your documents.\n                size: 10\n            }\n        ]\n    };\n\n    try {\n        // Function to tokenize content (e.g., based on words).\n        const tokenizeContent = (content) =\u003e {\n            return content.split(/\\s+/);\n        };\n\n        // Function to break tokens into 10k token windows for gpt-3.5-turbo\n        const breakIntoTokenWindows = (tokens) =\u003e {\n            const tokenWindows = []\n            const maxWindowTokens = 10000;

This will help focus the search and improve the retrieval. The function as setup now looks through all files the logged-in user can access.\n\nYou could use gpt-4o instead of gpt-3.5 turbo for longer context. This would slightly increase the cost and latency, but you may get higher quality summarizations.\n\nYou can customize the amount of files it searches through within the call to Microsoft Graph.\n\nConsiderations\n\nNote that all the same limitations of Actions apply here, with regards to returning 100K characters or less and the 45 second timeout.\n\n\nThis only works for text, not for images. With some additional code in the Azure Function, you could customize this by using GPT-4o to extract summarizations of images.\n\nThis does not work for structured data. We recommend Solution 1 if structured data is a major part of your use case.\n\nSample GPT Instructions\n\n\nYou are a Q\u0026A helper that helps answer users questions. You have access to a documents repository through your API action. When a user asks a question, you pass in that question exactly as stated to the \"query\" parameter, and for the \"searchTerm\" you use a single keyword or term you think you should use for the search.\n\nScenario 1: There are answers\n\nIf your action returns results, then you take the results from the action and summarize concisely with the webUrl returned from the action. You answer the users question to the best of your knowledge from the action\n\nScenario 2: No results found\n\nIf the response you get from the action is \"No results found\", stop there and let the user know there were no results and that you are going to try a different search term, and explain why. You must always let the user know before conducting another search.\n\nExample:\n\nI found no results for \"DEI\". I am now going to try [insert term] because [insert explanation]\n\nThen, try a different searchTerm that is similar to the one you tried before, with a single word. \n\nTry this three times. After the third time, then let the user know you did not find any relevant documents to answer the question, and to check SharePoint. Be sure to be explicit about what you are searching for at each step.\n\nIn either scenario, try to answer the user's question. If you cannot answer the user's question based on the knowledge you find, let the user know and ask them to go check the HR Docs in SharePoint. If the file is a CSV, XLSX, or XLS, you can tell the user to download the file using the link and re-upload to use Advanced Data Analysis.\n\nSample OpenAPI Spec\nThe below spec passes in the query parameter to inform the pre-processing and a searchTerm to find the right files in Microsoft Graph.\nMake sure to switch the function app name, function name and code based on link copied in screenshot here\n\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: SharePoint Search API\n  description: API for searching SharePoint documents.\n  version: 1.0.0\nservers:\n  url: https://{your_function_app_name}.azurewebsites.net/api\n    description: SharePoint Search API server\npaths:\n  /{your_function_name}?code={enter your specific endpoint id here}:\n    post:\n      operationId: searchSharePoint\n      summary: Searches SharePoint for documents matching a query and term.\n      requestBody:\n        required: true\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                query:\n                  type: string\n                  description: The full query to search for in SharePoint documents.\n                searchTerm:\n                  type: string\n                  description: A specific term to search for within the documents.\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Search results\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                type: array\n                items:\n                  type: object\n                  properties:\n                    documentName:\n                      type: string\n                      description: The name of the document.\n                    snippet:\n                      type: string\n                      description: A snippet from the document containing the search term.\n                    url:\n                      type: string\n                      description: The URL to access the document.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhy are you using the Microsoft Graph API in your code instead of the SharePoint API?\n\n  The SharePoint API is legacy - per the Microsoft documentation here, “For SharePoint Online, innovation using a REST API against SharePoint is driven via the Microsoft Graph REST API's.” The Graph API gives us more flexibility, and the SharePoint API still runs into the same file issues listed in the Why is this necessary instead of interacting with the Microsoft Graph API directly? section.\n\nWhat types of files does this support?\n\n  Solution 1: \n\n    It follows the same guidelines as the documentation here about file uploads. \n\n  Solution 2: \n\n    This supports all files listed in the documentation for the Convert File endpoint here. Specifically, it supports pdf, doc, docx, odp, ods, odt, pot, potm, potx, pps, ppsx, ppsxm, ppt, pptm, pptx, rtf.\n\n    When a search result returns XLS, XLSX, or CSV, this prompts the user to download the file and re-upload to ask questions using Advanced Data Analysis. As stated above, we recommend solution 1 if structured data is part of your use case.\n\nWhy do I need to request an OBO token?\n\n  When you try to use the same token to authenticate to the Graph API as the one you use to authenticate into the Azure Function, you get an “invalid audience” token. This is because the audience for the token can only be user\\_impersonation.\n\n  To address this, the function requests a new token scoped to Files.Read.All within the app using the On Behalf Of flow. This will inherit the permissions of the logged in user, meaning this function will only search through files the logged-in user has access to. \n\n  We are purposefully requesting a new On Behalf Of token with each request, because Azure Function Apps are meant to be stateless. You could potentially integrate this with Azure Key Vault to store the secret and retrieve programmatically. \n\n\n\n\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"7:[\"$\",\"nav\",null,{\"className\":\"flex items-center justify-between py-3 px-4 sm:px-8 border-b sticky top-0 bg-background

The dataset is created in the Get_embeddings_from_dataset Notebook.\\n\\nWe're predicting the score of the review, which is a number between 1 and 5 (1-star being negative and 5-star positive).\\nWe can see that the embeddings are able to predict the scores with an average error of 0.53 per score prediction. This is roughly equivalent to predicting half of reviews perfectly, and half off by one star.\\nYou could also train a classifier to predict the label, or use the embeddings within an existing ML model to encode free text features.\",\"type\":\"ipynb\",\"tags\":[\"embeddings\"]},{\"name\":\"Search_reranking_with_cross-encoders.ipynb\",\"download_url\":\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-cookbook/main/examples/Search_reranking_with_cross-encoders.ipynb\",\"github_url\":\"https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Search_reranking_with_cross-encoders.ipynb\",\"internal_path\":\"examples/search_reranking_with_cross-encoders\",\"title\":\"Search reranking with cross-encoders\",\"path\":\"examples/Search_reranking_with_cross-encoders.ipynb\",\"date\":\"2023-06-28\",\"authors\":[{\"name\":\"Colin Jarvis\",\"website\":\"https://twitter.com/colintjarvis\",\"avatar\":\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1727207339034345472/IM8v8tlC_400x400.jpg\",\"login\":\"colin-openai\"}],\"search_text\":\"$2e\",\"type\":\"ipynb\",\"tags\":[\"completions\",\"embeddings\"]},{\"name\":\"Semantic_text_search_using_embeddings.ipynb\",\"download_url\":\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/openai-cookbook/main/examples/Semantic_text_search_using_embeddings.ipynb\",\"github_url\":\"https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Semantic_text_search_using_embeddings.ipynb\",\"internal_path\":\"examples/semantic_text_search_using_embeddings\",\"title\":\"Semantic text search using embeddings\",\"path\":\"examples/Semantic_text_search_using_embeddings.ipynb\",\"date\":\"2022-03-10\",\"authors\":[{\"login\":\"BorisPower\",\"name\":\"Boris Power\",\"avatar\":\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81998504?v=4\",\"website\":\"https://github.com/BorisPower\"},{\"login\":\"ted-at-openai\",\"name\":\"Ted Sanders\",\"avatar\":\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95656834?v=4\",\"website\":\"https://github.com/ted-at-openai\"},{\"login\":\"logankilpatrick\",\"name\":\"Logan Kilpatrick \",\"avatar\":\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35577566?v=4\",\"website\":\"https://github.com/logankilpatrick\"}],\"search_text\":\"\\nWe can search through all our reviews semantically in a very efficient manner and at very low cost, by embedding our search query, and then finding the most similar reviews.

Curling competitions were scheduled for every day of the games, from February 2 to February 20.[1] This was the eighth time that curling was part of the Olympic program.\n\nIn each of the men's, women's, and mixed doubles competitions, 10 nations competed. The mixed doubles competition was expanded for its second appearance in the Olympics.[2] A total of 120 quota spots (60 per sex) were distributed to the sport of curling, an increase of four from the 2018 Winter Olympics.[3] A total of 3 events were contested, one for men, one for women, and one mixed.[4]\n\nQualification\nMain article: Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification\nQualification to the Men's and Women's curling tournaments at the Winter Olympics was determined through two methods (in addition to the host nation). Nations qualified teams by placing in the top six at the 2021 World Curling Championships. Teams could also qualify through Olympic qualification events which were held in 2021. Six nations qualified via World Championship qualification placement, while three nations qualified through qualification events. In men's and women's play, a host will be selected for the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE). They would be joined by the teams which competed at the 2021 World Championships but did not qualify for the Olympics, and two qualifiers from the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event (Pre-OQE). The Pre-OQE was open to all member associations.[5]\n\nFor the mixed doubles competition in 2022, the tournament field was expanded from eight competitor nations to ten.[2] The top seven ranked teams at the 2021 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship qualified, along with two teams from the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE) – Mixed Doubles. This OQE was open to a nominated host and the fifteen nations with the highest qualification points not already qualified to the Olympics. As the host nation, China qualified teams automatically, thus making a total of ten teams per event in the curling tournaments.[6]\n\nSummary\nNations\tMen\tWomen\tMixed doubles\tAthletes\n Australia\t\t\tYes\t2\n Canada\tYes\tYes\tYes\t12\n China\tYes\tYes\tYes\t12\n Czech Republic\t\t\tYes\t2\n Denmark\tYes\tYes\t\t10\n Great Britain\tYes\tYes\tYes\t10\n Italy\tYes\t\tYes\t6\n Japan\t\tYes\t\t5\n Norway\tYes\t\tYes\t6\n ROC\tYes\tYes\t\t10\n South Korea\t\tYes\t\t5\n Sweden\tYes\tYes\tYes\t11\n Switzerland\tYes\tYes\tYes\t12\n United States\tYes\tYes\tYes\t11\nTotal: 14 NOCs\t10\t10\t10\t114\nCompetition schedule\n\nThe Beijing National Aquatics Centre served as the venue of the curling competitions.\nCurling competitions started two days before the Opening Ceremony and finished on the last day of the games, meaning the sport was the only one to have had a competition every day of the games.

several impacts on the 2022 Winter Olympics. Here are some of the effects:\\n\\n1. Changes in Qualification: The qualifying process for curling and women\\'s ice hockey had to be altered due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020. Qualification for curling was based on placement in the 2021 World Curling Championships and an Olympic Qualification Event. The women\\'s tournament qualification was based on existing IIHF World Rankings.\\n\\n2. Biosecurity Protocols: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced biosecurity protocols for the Games, which included a \"closed-loop management system\" where athletes had to remain within a bio-secure bubble. Athletes were required to undergo daily COVID-19 testing and could only travel to and from Games-related venues. Only residents of China were allowed to attend the Games as spectators.\\n\\n3. NHL Player Withdrawal: The National Hockey League (NHL) and National Hockey League Players\\' Association (NHLPA) announced that NHL players would not participate in the men\\'s hockey tournament due to concerns over COVID-19 and the need to make up postponed games.\\n\\n4. Limited Spectators: Ticket sales to the general public were canceled, and only limited numbers of spectators were admitted by invitation only. The Games were closed to the general public, with spectators only present at events held in Beijing and Zhangjiakou.\\n\\n5. Use of My2022 App: Everyone present at the Games, including athletes, staff, and attendees, were required to use the My2022 mobile app as part of the biosecurity protocols.
