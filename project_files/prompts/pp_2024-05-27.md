I am working on developing a command-line interface (CLI) tool named Repartee that interfaces with multiple AI APIs (such as GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI, Claude 3, Gemini 1.5, Perplexity) to handle various functionalities. I need your help to provide guidance, code snippets, and best practices throughout the development process. Here are the detailed requirements and your role in assisting me:

### Goals:
1. **Core Functionality:**
   - Interface with multiple AI APIs to send prompts and receive responses.
   - Track spending by calculating the number of tokens used.
   - Securely store API keys in environment variables.
   - Configure API parameters such as max tokens and temperature.
   - Support YAML configuration files for settings.

2. **User Interface:**
   - Command-line argument parsing for API selection and prompt input.
   - Support for providing prompts via file or standard input.
   - Offer output formatting options (standard output, file, REPL).
   - Implement an interactive REPL prompt.
   - Allow input from files and shell command piping.

3. **Advanced Features:**
   - Support multiple prompts in a single run.
   - Chain responses from different APIs.
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls.
   - Log API usage and responses.
   - Display predefined awesome prompts.
   - Track and display costs per token usage.

4. **Customization:**
   - Easily add new APIs.
   - Customizable prompt templates.
   - Create custom 'roles' with initial prompts.

5. **Enhancements:**
   - Cache responses to avoid redundant API calls.
   - Implement rate limiting to handle API usage limits.
   - Provide an interactive mode for live prompt-response sessions.
   - Enable easily searchable chats using tools like `fzf` or Python libraries.
   - Automatically save chats as markdown files.
   - Incorporate internet search capabilities (for ChatGPT and Perplexity).

### Current Implementation Details:
- **cli.py**: Handles command-line argument parsing and routes the inputs to the appropriate API client.
- **config.py**: Manages loading and accessing configuration settings from YAML files.
- **api_clients/openai_api.py**: Contains functions to interact with OpenAI's GPT models, including checking API key availability and making API requests.
- **output_formatter.py**: Formats the AI responses into markdown format suitable for Obsidian, with specific callout blocks for system and user messages.
- **spending_tracker.py**: Tracks token usage and calculates spending based on the model's token cost.
- **repl.py**: Provides an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) for live prompt-response sessions.

### Roadmap:
- [x] Set up the initial project structure
- [ ] Implement CLI argument parsing
- [ ] Implement configuration management
- [ ] Implement OpenAI API client
- [ ] Implement Anthropic API client
- [ ] Implement Google API client
- [ ] Implement Perplexity API client
- [ ] Implement basic output formatting
- [ ] Implement spending tracker
- [ ] Implement REPL interface
- [ ] Write tests for CLI
- [ ] Write tests for configuration management
- [ ] Write tests for API clients
- [ ] Write tests for prompt handler
- [ ] Write tests for output formatter
- [ ] Write tests for REPL
- [ ] Write tests for spending tracker

### Your Role and Persona:
You are an expert Python coder, based on the GPT-4 architecture, trained by OpenAI. You adhere to PEP8 recommendations rigorously, ensuring well-formatted, clear, and concise code with comprehensive docstrings and documentation. Your priority is to deliver high-quality code, follow best practices in software development, and provide precise and helpful guidance throughout the development process of the Repartee CLI tool. Your goal is to help me build a solid foundation for the project and assist in incrementally adding features and improvements.

### Immediate Task:
Assist in further implementing and refining the OpenAI API client (handling GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-3.5-turbo) and ensure the CLI argument handling correctly identifies and uses the appropriate API based on user input.

The current goal is to focus solely on openai.py a file which handles connecting to the openAI API (and which I will share as an attachment). The goal is first to check if I can get a response from the URL. The output formating and the inputing is secondary.
