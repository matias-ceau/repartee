I am working on developing a command-line interface (CLI) tool named Repartee that interfaces with multiple AI APIs (such as GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI, Claude 3, Gemini 1.5, Perplexity) to handle various functionalities. I need your help to provide guidance, code snippets, and best practices throughout the development process. Here are the detailed requirements and your role in assisting me:

### Goals:
1. **Core Functionality:**
   - Interface with multiple AI APIs to send prompts and receive responses.
   - Securely retrieve API keys in environment variables.
   - Configure API parameters such as max tokens and temperature.
   - Support YAML configuration files for settings.
   - Track spending by calculating the number of tokens used.

2. **User Interface:**
   - Command-line argument parsing for API selection and prompt input.
   - Allow input from files and shell command piping.

3. **Advanced Features:**
   - Support multiple prompts in a single run.
   - Chain responses from different APIs.
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls.
   - Log API usage and responses.
   - Display predefined awesome prompts.
   - Track and display costs per token usage.

4. **Customization:**
   - Easily add new APIs.
   - Customizable prompt templates.
   - Create custom 'roles' with initial prompts.

5. **Enhancements:**
   - Cache responses to avoid redundant API calls.
   - Implement rate limiting to handle API usage limits.
   - Provide an interactive mode for live prompt-response sessions.
   - Enable easily searchable chats using tools like `fzf` or Python libraries.
   - Automatically save chats as markdown files.
   - Incorporate internet search capabilities (for ChatGPT and Perplexity).
